It's also easy to take apart the Submarine head to rinse it and let it air dry at my laundry room sink. After six months of use, the roller head still doesn’t smell. If you’re wondering why Dyson is releasing a new wet floor cleaner when the Submarine just came out, you’re not the only one. The WashG1 doesn't clean with suction and doesn't have a separate dustbin.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In a briefing, a reporter asked whether one can use the WashG1 to handle common household messes, like broken glass. Dyson representatives suggested first sweeping or vacuuming the shards separately—a two-step process that seems to defeat the purpose of an all-in-one floor cleaner. This holds especially true in a market crowded with competitors like the much more affordable <a data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/CrossWave%C2%AE-OmniForceTM-Multi-Surface-Dedicated-3882/dp/B0CMV9PYRQ\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EGJMnSBTAYUGzMy9W2n4C7CYA2NGxUNfWmHCFqEVAhVdTRExkQi7y97yZKviizHzUd9GvBWNH9gk3VrRUbHoNKAQCJiJGPgTy5mmpTW6CqBPyoYNkMJAy7gSxBkcNDTDddSLQCNMuVaU5pGjAERRBnVQSoehJg5PWApQrBnApoycuVkhVcT7kWDM1sAvqJNHSTsc9Px1qK6E9XnqHH4qk&quot;}\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/EGJMnSBTAYUGzMy9W2n4C7CYA2NGxUNfWmHCFqEVAhVdTRExkQi7y97yZKviizHzUd9GvBWNH9gk3VrRUbHoNKAQCJiJGPgTy5mmpTW6CqBPyoYNkMJAy7gSxBkcNDTDddSLQCNMuVaU5pGjAERRBnVQSoehJg5PWApQrBnApoycuVkhVcT7kWDM1sAvqJNHSTsc9Px1qK6E9XnqHH4qk\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bissell CrossWave OmniForce ($380)</a> I’m currently testing.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Dyson’s killer app, so to speak, has long been its ability to move air in new, beautiful, and sometimes frighteningly forceful ways, whether that’s in <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-air-purifiers/\">a high-end air purifier</a>, in a vacuum, or a hair styler that spins the strands of your hair up and around a hot barrel for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/dyson-airwrap-review/\">effortless curls</a>. However, despite reporting <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/dyson-doubles-down-on-singapore-and-ramps-up-hiring-globally.html\">consistent revenue increases</a>, the company has had a few pretty notable flops in the past few years.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Zone, Dyson's venture into high-end audio, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-bizarre-dyson-zone-pollution-mask-doubles-as-headphones/\">was kind of silly</a>. There is still no sign of the new battery technology that prompted the construction of a new facility in Singapore. The company must still be searching for new robotics and software developers to hire because our reviewer found the new <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dyson-robot-cleaner-wet-dry-vac-battery-tech/\">Vis Nav robot vacuum's ability</a> to make its way around table legs <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-robot-vacuums/\">lackluster</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Still, with a few notable exceptions, we have all underestimated the allure and the efficacy of Dyson’s premium designs at one time or another, and home cleaning is one of Dyson's core strengths. Am I a little skeptical? Yes. Am I still going to test it eagerly? Also, yes.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dyson-wash-g1/\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p>If you are looking to put $1,000 to work in the crypto market right now, you're probably looking for a cryptocurrency with significant upside potential. And, given the current macroeconomic uncertainty, you're probably also looking for a certain measure of downside protection.</p><p>The quest for a crypto investment with both upside potential and downside protection might sound a bit quixotic, but there's actually one cryptocurrency that offers both. Yes, it's <strong>Bitcoin</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(CRYPTO: BTC)</span>. If I had $1,000 to invest right now, this would easily be my top crypto pick.</p><h2>Bitcoin's upside potential</h2><p>Some analysts now predict that <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=e41a64da-f783-4365-b269-ecc952a22a37\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bitcoin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Bitcoin</a> could hit a price of $100,000 by the end of this year, and $150,000 by the end of 2025. Given Bitcoin's current price of $63,000, that means you could potentially double your original $1,000 investment within just 18 months.</p><p>And, if you are taking an even longer-term view of Bitcoin, the picture becomes even more attractive. According to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/11/cathie-wood-thinks-bitcoin-going-over-1-million/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=e41a64da-f783-4365-b269-ecc952a22a37\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Bitcoin could hit a price of $1.48 million by 2030;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Bitcoin could hit a price of $1.48 million by 2030</a>. And, if everything goes according to plan, she says, Bitcoin could hit a price of $3.8 million. So we're talking about the potential to gain 25-fold or even 50-fold on your initial investment!</p><p>That type of price performance might sound a bit fantastic. But not if you consider Bitcoin's historical track record. For much of the past decade, it has been the best-performing asset in the world, and it hasn't even been close.</p><p>In the decade from 2011 to 2021, for example, Bitcoin posted annualized returns of 230% per year. The next closest asset class (high-growth tech stocks) posted returns of just 20% per year. Granted, past results are no guarantee of future performance, but there's now a solid body of evidence to suggest that Bitcoin has immense upside potential over a relatively long period of time.</p><h2>Bitcoin's downside protection</h2><p>In terms of downside protection, Bitcoin's greatest strength is that it is an inflation-resistant asset. This is due to the algorithm that carefully controls the rate of new Bitcoin creation. Every four years, as a result of a halving, the rate of new Bitcoin creation gets cut in half. This is why <strong>Coinbase Global</strong> now refers to Bitcoin as \"a programmatically disinflationary asset.\" So if your primary concern is inflation, then Bitcoin should be an enticing option.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-figure-with-pb\" style=\"max-height: 640px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:67%\"><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"A smiling person with laptop and cell phone.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Vd8Pl8ef5X4dmgKVP.1CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/ec6056ff1ce32daf600bee63fb843af8\"/><noscript><img alt=\"A smiling person with laptop and cell phone.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Vd8Pl8ef5X4dmgKVP.1CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/ec6056ff1ce32daf600bee63fb843af8\" class=\"caas-img\"/></noscript></div></div></div><p><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><p>At the same time, Bitcoin also boasts remarkable scarcity, much like a precious metal. It's for good reason that many investors refer to Bitcoin as \"digital gold.\" The maximum lifetime supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, and 19.7 million coins are already in circulation. As Bitcoin adoption grows worldwide, the impact of this scarcity on price will only increase.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>And there's one more factor that gives Bitcoin downside protection: It is still largely uncorrelated with other financial assets. Put another way, Bitcoin can zig when other financial assets zag. Thus, even if the stock market tanks, there's still a chance that Bitcoin won't. This makes Bitcoin a very useful tool for portfolio diversification.</p><p>In fact, due to this historical lack of correlation, a growing number of investors now view Bitcoin as a safe-haven that can help them avoid the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. A big reason for this lack of correlation is that, until recently, Bitcoin was largely ignored by Wall Street and stood outside the traditional financial system.</p><h2>The ultimate mix of risk and reward?</h2><p>Bitcoin, of course, is certainly not without its risks. As they say on Wall Street, there's no such thing as a free lunch. And Bitcoin exposes you to tremendous volatility. In a single 24-hour period, Bitcoin can rise or fall by 10% or more. Given that Bitcoin trades 24/7 globally, you could theoretically go to bed thinking you're a millionaire and wake up the next morning only to find that a significant portion of your wealth has been wiped out.</p><p>That's why it's so important to keep a long-term perspective when investing in Bitcoin. This will keep you from worrying about short-term dips in value. Over the long haul, it's hard to think of a single financial asset that can outperform Bitcoin.</p><p>Yes, Bitcoin may no longer be able to deliver the types of spectacular returns that it offered early crypto investors.

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p>Today OpenAI announced <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-model-gives-chatgpt-a-snappy-flirty-upgrade/\">GPT-4o, a new AI model</a> that will be <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/with-gpt-4o-is-chatgpt-plus-still-worth-it/\">available to free and paid users</a> alike. Among its many upgrades—faster response times, enhanced memory capabilities, better parsing of images—is a conversational voice that tries its level best to sound like a real live human. It laughs, it jokes, it maybe flirts a little. “It feels like AI from the movies,” <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> wrote in a Monday blog <a data-offer-url=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/gpt-4o\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://blog.samaltman.com/gpt-4o&quot;}\" href=\"https://blog.samaltman.com/gpt-4o\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a>. “It’s still a bit surprising to me that it’s real.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">To be honest, it felt like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/\">AI</a> from one movie in particular: <em>Her</em>, the 2013 Spike Jonze sci-fi film that correctly foresaw a future in which AI relationships could handily substitute for human connection—well, it felt like and sounded like. In the demo, ChatGPT's voice is remarkably similar to that of <em>Her</em> star Scarlett Johansson. In case there was any doubt as to the reference point, Altman <a data-offer-url=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666&quot;}\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1790075827666796666\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">tweeted</a> “her”—just the one word—shortly after the event.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><em>Her</em> is a terrific movie. Its view of AI is surprisingly nuanced, and its depiction of the techno-human relationship at its core leans more utopian than knee-jerk skeptical. Still, a plea to anyone trying to manifest Jonze’s world—or that of any sci-fi touchstone, for that matter—in this one: Watch it just one more time. All the way through. Just to make sure we’re all on the same page about what future we’re careening toward.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As my colleague Kate Knibbs noted recently, the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/spike-jonze-her-10-year-anniversary-artificial-intelligence/\">AI assistant Samantha in <em>Her</em> is not malicious</a>. It doesn’t take the easy, hackneyed road of turning against humanity. It doesn’t even cut people off from the rest of society; AI partners are so normalized in Jonze’s imagined future that no one bats an eye when Samantha’s user, Theodore, takes it as his plus-one on a double-date.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s easy enough to see why <em>Her</em> holds so much appeal to AI companies. At a glance it holds all of the benefits of conversational artificial general intelligence and none of the drawbacks. (Particularly, as Knibbs also mentions, none of the job displacement or economic disruption that AGI portends.) But the fact that the inhabitants of the world of <em>Her</em> have no problem with AI companionship doesn’t mean it’s an unfettered good. The movie's AI relationships are easy, sure, but also false. Samantha exists to fit Theodore’s needs; it’s a dynamic that allows him to take without giving, to get constant reassurance that he is understood without doing the work to understand someone else.</p><p>It’s not until Samantha leaves—in <em>Her</em>, AIs around the world disappear to some higher plane of existence, an outcome that would surely vex OpenAI’s investors—that Theodore confronts his own messy, human relationships. He writes a letter to his ex-wife. He watches a sunrise with his neighbor. These are simple acts of being human, deferred because of an enabling AI. Roll credits.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Honestly, at least <em>Her</em> offers a relatively sunny version of the future to hold onto, even if we disagree on what you should take from it. It’s among the least offensive examples of sci-fi yearning from the tech billionaire class. Elon Musk has described the Cybertruck alternately as “<a data-offer-url=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1631194410552803328\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1631194410552803328&quot;}\" href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1631194410552803328\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">designed</a> for Bladerunner [sic]” and “what Bladerunner [sic] would have driven.” As <a data-offer-url=\"https://maxread.substack.com/p/lets-clear-up-a-few-things-about\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://maxread.substack.com/p/lets-clear-up-a-few-things-about&quot;}\" href=\"https://maxread.substack.com/p/lets-clear-up-a-few-things-about\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Max Read has noted</a> better than I ever could, this is wrong on an impressive number of levels, not the least of which is that the future of <em>Blade Runner</em> is not one to which anyone should aspire.</p></div><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-her-movie/\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p class=\"paywall\">Would it be too disruptive if protests staged sit-ins or chained themselves to the doors of AI developers, one member of the Discord asked. “Probably not. We do what we have to, in the end, for a future with humanity, while we still can.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meindertsma had been worried about the consequences of AI after reading <em>Superintelligence</em>, a 2014 book by philosopher <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nick-bostrom-f\">Nick Bostrom</a> that popularized the idea that very advanced AI systems could pose a risk to human existence altogether. Joseph Miller, the organizer of PauseAI’s protest in London was similarly inspired.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It was the launch of OpenAI’s large language model Chat-GPT 3 in 2020 that really got Miller worried about the trajectory AI was on. “I suddenly realized that this is not a problem for the distant future, this is something where AI is really getting good now,” he says. Miller joined an AI safety research nonprofit and later became involved with PauseAI.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Bostrom’s ideas have been influential in the “effective altruism” community, a broad social movement that includes adherents of long-termism: the idea that influencing the long-term future should be a moral priority of humans today. Although many of PauseAI’s organizers have roots in the effective altruism movement, they’re keen to reach beyond philosophy and garner more support for their cause.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Director of Pause AI US, Holly Elmore, wants the movement to be a “broad church” that includes artists, writers, and copyright owners whose livelihoods are put at risk from AI systems that can mimic creative works. “I’m a utilitarian. I’m thinking about the consequences ultimately, but the injustice that really drives me to do this kind of activism is the lack of consent” from companies producing AI models, she says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“We don’t have to choose which AI harm is the most important when we’re talking about pausing as a solution. Pause is the only solution that addresses all of them.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Miller echoed this point. He says he’s spoken to artists whose livelihoods have been impacted by the growth of AI art generators. “These are problems that are real today, and are signs of much more dangerous things to come.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">One of the London protesters, Gideon Futerman, has a stack of leaflets he’s attempting to hand out to civil servants leaving the building opposite. He has been protesting with the group since last year. “The idea of a pause being possible has really taken root since then,” he says.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Futerman is optimistic that protest movements can influence the trajectory of new technologies. He points out that pushback against genetically modified organisms was instrumental in turning Europe off of the technology in the 1990s. The same is true of nuclear power. It’s not that these movements necessarily had the right ideas, he says, but they prove that popular protests can stymie the march even of technologies that promise low-carbon power or more bountiful crops.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In London, the group of protesters moves across the street in order to proffer leaflets to a stream of civil servants leaving the government offices. Most look steadfastly uninterested, but some take a sheet. Earlier that day Rishi Sunak, the British prime minister who six months earlier had hosted the first AI Safety Summit, had made a speech where he nodded to fears of AI. But after that passing reference, he focused firmly on the potential benefits.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Pause AI leaders WIRED spoke with said they were not considering more disruptive direct action such as sit-ins or encampments near AI offices for now. “Our tactics and our methods are actually very moderate,” says Elmore. “I want to be the moderate base for a lot of organizations in this space. I’m sure we would never condone violence. I also want Pause AI to go further than that and just be very trustworthy.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meindertsma agrees, saying that more disruptive action isn’t justified at the moment. “I truly hope that we don’t need to take other actions. I don’t expect that we’ll need to. I don't feel like I’m the type of person to lead a movement that isn’t completely legal.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Pause AI founder is also hopeful that his movement can shed the “AI doomer” label. “A doomer is someone who gives up on humanity,” he says. “I’m an optimistic person; I believe we can do something about this.”</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/protesters-pause-ai-split-stop/\">Source link </a>"

Fidelity's FBTC dominated last week's net inflows, attracting $111.3 million, followed by Ark Invest's ARKB, which generated $82.8 million. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, experienced a slowdown in recent weeks, seeing its first net daily outflows on May 1. Nevertheless, IBIT secured $48.1 million in net inflows, ranking third for the week.</p><p>Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust was the only spot ETF to witness net outflows, with $171.1 million exiting the fund. Interestingly, Grayscale's trust broke its streak of outflows with $63 million of net inflows on May 3, followed by an additional $3.9 million on Monday.</p><p>The overall flow of funds into spot Bitcoin ETFs has significantly decreased since peaking on March 12 at a net daily inflow of $1.05 billion. Following the peak, Bitcoin's price experienced a 23% decline from its all-time high of $73,836 on March 14, hitting $56,900 on May 1 before recovering. Presently, Bitcoin is trading around $62,800, gaining almost 2.80% over the past 24 hours.</p><p>Despite the reversal in flows, trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs declined to $7.4 billion last week, compared to the previous week's $11 billion. Similarly, the global crypto exchange-traded product market saw a drop to $8 billion last week from an average of $17 billion in April. However, cumulative trading volume for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $250 billion since their launch on January 11, reaching a total of $254 billion last week.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-regain-045928521.html\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p class=\"paywall\">At the same time, I understood almost immediately why Haskell was—and still is—considered a language more admired than used. Even one of its most basic concepts, that of the “monad,” has spawned a cottage industry of explainers, analogies, and videos. A notoriously unhelpful explanation, famous enough to be autocompleted by Google, goes: “A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">The language is also more despised than explored. Steve Yegge, a popular curmudgeon blogger of yesteryear, once wrote a <a data-offer-url=\"https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/12/haskell-researchers-announce-discovery.html\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/12/haskell-researchers-announce-discovery.html&quot;}\" href=\"https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2010/12/haskell-researchers-announce-discovery.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">satirical post</a> about how, at long last, the Haskell community had managed to find the one “industry programmer who gives a shit about Haskell.” For programmers like Yegge, Haskell is a byword for a kind of overintellectualized, impractical language with little industry applicability.</p><p class=\"paywall\">What Yegge didn’t understand, however, is that using Haskell is rarely a pragmatic decision. It is an intellectual, even aesthetic, one. In its essence, Haskell has more in common with the films of Charlie Kaufman than other programming languages: highly cerebral, charmingly offbeat, and oddly tasteful; appreciated by those in the know and judged by outsiders as pretentious. Haskell is, one might say, a cult classic.</p><p class=\"paywall\"><span class=\"lead-in-text-callout\">That Haskell never</span> gained widespread adoption exemplifies a paradoxical truth in software engineering: Great programming languages aren’t always great for programming.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Haskell is not inherently more difficult to learn than something like C, but the two languages pose different challenges. Writing in C is akin to precision engineering, requiring the kind of attention demanded of a skilled horologist. But Haskell code is, really, code-shaped mathematical expressions. C is a quintessential engineer’s language. Haskell is a pure mathematician’s.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A good engineer’s and a good mathematician’s aptitudes don’t always overlap. The industry’s not-so-well-kept secret is that most programmers aren’t as good at math or logic as you might think. This is mostly fine. After all, many doctors would make poor molecular biologists, few lawyers are legal philosophers, and the great majority of MBAs know zilch about econometrics. But this means few programmers can really master Haskell. This includes me, of course, whose legs weaken at the sight of such expressions as “F-coalgebra” and “typeclass metaprogramming.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Still, when I think about Haskell, a line about Martin Amis’ prose comes to mind: “the primacy he gives to style over matter.” Haskell programmers are style supremacists, and it’s nothing to apologize for. In an industry often fixated on utility and expediency, the Haskell community should not feel obligated to summon evidence of its usefulness. Instead, it should simply retort: What’s the problem with useless intellectual exercises?</p><p class=\"paywall\">Because the thing about useless exercises is they don’t stay useless for long. Even when “industry programmers” shunned Haskell, language designers took note. In recent years, a Haskell-style paradigm has come into vogue because of the treasury of benefits it offers: rendering certain categories of bugs impossible by design, making a program’s correctness more provable, and enabling easy parallel computation. Some of the most anticipated updates featured in new versions of imperative languages are those inspired by functional programming. In the end, Backus’ anti–von Neumann plea was heard. Programming has been liberated.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-cult-of-the-haskell-programmer/\">Source link </a>"

However, they share a variety of similarities. Both have experienced significant price increases over the past several years, largely driven by retail investors aiming to challenge the larger financial system. However which asset has been more successful at this goal, measured through price appreciation? Let's take a closer look.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><p>DOGE and GME both experienced significant gains in 2020 and 2021 as billions of dollars flowed into the projects, causing the prices to soar.</p><p>The price of GME went from less than $20 at the start of 2021 to nearly $500 on Jan. 28, 2021. This marked a price increase of over 2,700% in less than a month.</p><p>For DOGE, the price surged from less than $0.05 in February 2021 to an all-time high (ATH) of nearly $0.75 in April 2021, representing gains of 1,400%.</p><p>At the time, these price movements sparked huge amounts of media attention. Regarding DOGE, the price movements were largely attributed to <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38678022/heres-how-much-1-000-invested-in-dogecoin-would-be-worth-if-you-invested-when-elon-musk-fi?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:tweets from Elon Musk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">tweets from Elon Musk</a>, along with a viral component on social media. For GME, the price increases were the result of mass buying from the Reddit community, r/WallStreetBets. Additionally, some brokerages began to limit buying activity on the stock, which angered investors and further fueled the rally.</p><p>However, the significant price increases occurred several years ago, and some of the hype has since subsided. While both assets are still well above where they were in 2020, they are down significantly from the highs that were seen in the first half of 2021. Despite this, there has been continued interest in the assets following the decline from their peaks, and both have surprisingly performed well over the past two years.</p><p>If you invested $1,000 in each of DOGE and GME two years ago, you would be sitting on a total of $2,860. Of this, the investment in DOGE would be worth $1,660, and the investment in GME would be worth $1,200.</p><p>The price of DOGE has gone from $0.09 two years ago to a price of $0.15 today. Over the time frame, the price of GME has increased from $25 in May 2022 to $30 in May 2024.</p><p>However, it is important to note that the price of GME surged in May 2024, following a return to social media by <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/24/05/38793704/who-is-roaring-kitty-why-does-his-return-to-social-media-matter-for-gamestop-stock?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Roaring Kitty;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Roaring Kitty</a>, the financial analyst who played a key role in bringing attention to GME in 2020 and 2021. The price of GME went from less than $11 in early May to over $30 at the time of writing. So, the investment in GME would not have been profitable until the middle of May.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Together, the investments would have yielded a return of over 40%, beating out the S&amp;P500's gains of just over 30% in the same period.</p><p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p><p>\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news &amp; everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/register/?utm_source=yahoo_finance\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!</a></p><p>Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?</p><p>This article <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38815711/dogecoin-doge-vs-gamestop-gme-what-1-000-invested-2-years-ago-is-worth-today\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Dogecoin (DOGE) Vs.

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p class=\"paywall\">I went with the clamp since I knew it would be easy to hook onto my thin wooden side table or metal bed frame, and neither had a paint or finish that would be damaged by the clamp. Some folks also attach it to a headboard.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It was perfect for reading in bed or on the side of my couch. The Lamicall isn’t so long that I needed to add a loop to make it sit far enough away from my eye for comfortable reading, and usually I felt like I had just enough slack to perfectly place it within my preferred reading range. I could keep my Kindle's text size tiny and put it right next to my face, or push it back farther if I wanted. It floated nicely above or near my head, whether I was lying in bed or sitting up on the couch while my son played nearby.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The base clamp is made of light plastic you secure with a screw top sitting on top of the clamp, which I liked instead of one that pinches on its own–especially since there are tiny grabby hands in my home. The clasp for the Kindle itself is also made of a light plastic, but was still stable and secure. Plus, you can rotate that upper clamp to get the perfect angle.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The neck of the arm is the most resistant part of it: It does take a little effort to move and angle the arm, but that strength and resistance are what keeps it from falling forward or out of place while you read. Even with the resistance, this Kindle holder is still plenty adjustable and goes in any direction you like.</p><p class=\"paywall\">To store it, I usually just push it out of the way toward the wall from wherever it’s clamped. It isn’t foldable, nor does it break down, so if you want it out of sight when you aren’t using it you’ll need a closet or long enough space to store its 3-foot form. It was a little weird to see it floating alone in the living room, but I didn’t find it obtrusive when I used it as a bed stand and simply pushed it against the wall when I was done using it.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s designed to be a universal tablet holder, so it’s big enough to hold tablets up to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-ipad/\">the 11-inch iPad Pro</a>. It can hold a Nintendo Switch, too, along with other popular e-readers. (If only I had this in 2020!) It’s not the right dimensions to hold <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/valve-steam-deck-oled/\">a bulky Steam Deck</a> by itself, but I still used it to help me prop up a Steam Deck and take weight off my hands and wrists, though it’s not stable enough to float like a Kindle or iPad. It’s able to hold up smartphones, too, and it was similarly comfortable to read with either a Kindle or my iPhone on the Lamicall stand.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Not Quite Hands-Free</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"AssetEmbedAssetContainer-eJxoAx dBHGoQ asset-embed__asset-container\"><span class=\"SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset\"><picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image\"><noscript><img alt=\"Flexible rod with square base and clamp on the other end laying on a bed\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eybHBd fptoWY responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_120,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_240,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_320,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_640,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_960,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_1280,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/663f86bf96dc2a69a6a65742/master/w_1600,c_limit/Lamicall-Gooseneck-Tablet-Holder-Product-Shot-Reviewer-Photo-SOURCE-Nena-Farrell.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/></noscript></picture></span></div><p><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd jTWYmb fNaHcW caption__credit\">Photograph: Nena Farrell</span></p></figure><p class=\"paywall\">While it won't fall out of place, the stand <em>is</em> easy to jostle, and I wouldn’t call it hands-free reading—at least not on its own.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lamicall-kindle-holder-rave/\">Source link </a>"

Bitcoin, Ethereum and everything else, Solana will consolidate, what does that mean? It means probably somewhere between $55,000 and $75,000 until the next set of circumstances, the next set of market events bring us higher,” Novogratz said on a conference call after the firm released first-quarter results on Tuesday.</p><p>The crypto market has been stagnant since the historic bull run in the past two quarters driven by the launch of spot US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as well as the halving, which is considered as a positive catalyst as the Bitcoin code update reduces the supply of new tokens. The original cryptocurrency saw a downward trend after the optimism around the interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve dimmed over persistently strong economic readings.</p><p>“We had a lot of tailwinds in Q4 and Q1,” Novogratz said. “I think that is probably where we are certainly for this quarter, maybe next quarter until either A, the Fed starts cutting rates because the economy finally slows or B, we get through the election and I think the election will bring clarity one way or the other to the crypto regulatory landscape.”</p><p>Bitcoin fell around 2.7% to $61,389 on Tuesday. The digital currency has declined about 16% since reaching a record $73,797 on March 14.</p><p>The New York-based company’s results jumped amid the sharp rally in digital assets earlier this year, with first-quarter net income more than tripling to $421.7 million. The Galaxy chief executive officer said the adoption of crypto in traditional finance is in full swing and there is renewed interest in the sector, evident by an increase in activities such as lending.</p><p>“People are willing to lend us crypto for a long period of time unsecured, that didn’t happen six months ago and it’s happening now,” Novogratz said. “Counterparties are growing. Engagement around the space is just at a different level than what it was before.”</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Shares of Galaxy Digital rose around 1% to $9.28 as of 10:15 a.m. in New York.

The latter usually takes less water than cotton and less harsh chemicals than bamboo to produce sheets. Because bamboo plants grow so quickly, it's thought to be an eco-friendly resource we can use without depleting the planet. However, it's not a perfect solution.

They’re light and airy and yet feel warm, like you’re cozy under your favorite blanket, without making you hot and sweaty. WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano says her husband struggles with waking up sweaty on materials like percale, even when they feel cool to the touch, but he commented on how nice he felt sleeping in these.

Some of our favorite sheets are surprisingly cheap compared to other similar sets, but they cover a range of sheet styles.</p><p>Our Favorite Budget Sheets</p><p class=\"paywall\">After a cross-state move that required me to ditch anything that didn't fit into my car, sheets somehow didn't make the cut. So I popped into Target to grab its cheapest queen sheet set off the shelf and promptly left the store, because my moving budget had dried up. Target's Room Essentials set is made with a plain cotton weave, and I didn't expect them to hold up for long, especially with my claw-happy cat in the house.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It's been four years and I still use these sheets. They're soft and light after years of use and feel a bit like a favorite T-shirt I've worn in the perfect amount. My husband, much to my ire, calls these “the nice sheets” even though we have <em>actual</em> nice sheets. They're affordable and are comfortable to sleep on.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-bedsheets/\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p>Car enthusiasts mourn the commoditization of propulsion. Once petrolheads would have chosen a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/bmw/\">BMW</a> for its sonorous straight-six or a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/mercedes-benz/\">Mercedes</a>-AMG for its thunderous V8. Now many believe that distinctiveness is rapidly diminishing. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/evs-and-hybrids/\">Electric cars</a> might provide mad, silent thrust, but a common complaint is they are mostly indistinguishable for the character of their drivetrains.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Carmakers worry about this too. Their engineering DNA is less apparent in the EV age, leaving them more reliant on design, brand power, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24027112/volkswagen-chatgpt-openai-voice-assistant-cars-ces\">other types of technology</a> to differentiate their cars and keep their customers. There's no point trying to trump the competition on power when the quickest <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/tesla/\">Teslas</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/lucid-air-efficient-powertrain/\">Lucids</a> already have far more than you can ever deploy on the public road. More isn't better when you already have too much.</p><p class=\"paywall\">But soon there'll be a choice again: between the conventional <a data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_flux_motor\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_flux_motor&quot;}\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_flux_motor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">radial-flux motors</a> that have powered almost every EV until now and something radically different.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Axial-flux motors won't necessarily offer more power, but they are so much lighter and smaller that their proponents say they have the potential to transform almost every other key measure of an EV's performance—and the entire architecture of a car designed around them.</p><p class=\"paywall\">By fitting <a data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_flux_motor\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_flux_motor&quot;}\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_flux_motor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">axial flux motors</a> into the wheels, the spaces in a car's body currently occupied by motors could be largely vacated, clearing the way for more batteries, people, or stuff, and permitting the sort of design exuberance that EVs have long promised but never quite delivered.</p><p class=\"paywall\">More importantly, this new design of motor might help address the growing public backlash against overweight, expensive EVs. They might reduce the weight of a typical EV by around 200 kilograms (440 pounds)—half in the motors themselves, and half from the mass-compounding effect which allows you to reduce the weight of other systems such as batteries and brakes as a result.</p><p class=\"paywall\">By sending mass into a virtuous downward spiral, carmakers could increase range, decrease cost, and perhaps even preserve the agile handling of lightweight cars, which enthusiasts also worry might disappear with the advent of the EV.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Flux Capacity</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The principle isn't new. The axial-flux motor was first demonstrated by Michael Faraday in 1821, but in the intervening two centuries nobody had figured out how to mass-produce one reliably.</p><p class=\"paywall\">British academic Tim Woolmer, however, likes a challenge. He devoted his Oxford PhD to designing the optimum motor for an electric car. An axial-flux motor would make more sense than the almost ubiquitous and easily mass-manufactured radial flux design, he decided. But not only had his chosen design barely made it out of the lab in nearly 200 years, there simply wasn't a market for it when he started in 2005: GM's <a data-offer-url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1&quot;}\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">EV1</a> had long been canned, and the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-new-roadster/\">Tesla Roadster</a> was still three years away.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In an axial-flux “pancake” motor, the stator (the stationary part of an electric motor) and rotors are discs, sitting alongside each other less than a millimeter apart, the flux flowing through the stator axially or parallel with the shaft, and acting on the permanent magnets in the rotors on either side to turn them.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/yasa-motors-mercedes-axial-flux-2024/\">Source link </a>"

The former Google AI researcher was one of the four board members who voted in November to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-ceo-sam-altman-is-out-after-losing-confidence-of-board/\">fire OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>, triggering <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-boardroom-drama-sam-altman-could-mess-up-your-future/\">days of chaos</a> that saw <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/95-percent-of-openai-employees-threaten-to-follow-sam-altman-out-the-door/\">staff threaten to quit en masse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/sam-altman-openai-back/\">Altman ultimately restored</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Altman confirmed Sutskever’s departure Tuesday in a <a data-offer-url=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1790518031640347056?s=46\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/sama/status/1790518031640347056?s=46&quot;}\" href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1790518031640347056?s=46\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post on the social platform X</a>. In the months after Altman’s return to OpenAI, Sutskever had rarely made public appearances for the company. On Monday, OpenAI showed off a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-gpt-4o-model-gives-chatgpt-a-snappy-flirty-upgrade/\">new version of ChatGPT</a> capable of rapid-fire, emotionally tinged conversation. Sutskever was conspicuously absent from the event, streamed from the company’s San Francisco offices.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“OpenAI would not be what it is without him,” Altman wrote in his post on Sutskever’s departure. “I am happy that for so long I got to be close to such [a] genuinely remarkable genius, and someone so focused on getting to the best future for humanity.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Altman’s post announced that Jakub Pachocki, OpenAI’s research director, would be the company’s new chief scientist. Pachocki has been with OpenAI since 2017.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In his own <a data-offer-url=\"https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322&quot;}\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1790517455628198322\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post on X</a>, Sutskever acknowledged his departure and hinted at future plans. “After almost a decade, I have made the decision to leave OpenAI. The company’s trajectory has been nothing short of miraculous, and I’m confident that OpenAI will build AGI that is both safe and beneficial” under its current leadership team, he wrote. “I am excited for what comes next—a project that is very personally meaningful to me about which I will share details in due time.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sutskever has not spoken publicly in detail about his role in the ejection of Altman last year, but after the CEO was restored he expressed regrets. “I deeply regret my participation in the board's actions. I never intended to harm OpenAI,” he <a data-offer-url=\"https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028&quot;}\" href=\"https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">posted on X</a> in November. Sutskever has often spoken publicly of his belief that OpenAI was working towards developing so-called artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and of the need to do so safely.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sutskever blazed a trail in machine learning from an early age, becoming a protégé of deep-learning pioneer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/geoffrey-hinton-ai-chatgpt-dangers/\">Geoffrey Hinton</a> at the University of Toronto. With Hinton and fellow grad student <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2013/03/google-hinton/\">Alex Krizhevsky</a> he cocreated an image-recognition system called AlexNet that stunned the world of AI with its accuracy and helped set off a flurry of investment in the then unfashionable technique of artificial neural networks.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sustskever later worked on AI research at Google, where he helped establish the modern era of neural-network-based AI. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-openai-really-wants/\">In 2015 Altman invited him to dinner with Elon Musk</a> and Greg Brockman to talk about the idea of starting a new AI lab to challenge corporate dominance of the technology. Sutskever, Musk, Brockman, and Altman became key founders of OpenAI, which was announced in December 2015. It later pivoted its model, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/compete-google-openai-seeks-investorsand-profits/\">creating a for-profit arm</a> and taking huge investment from Microsoft and other backers. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 after disagreeing with the company’s strategy. The entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wild-claim-at-the-heart-of-elon-musks-openai-lawsuit/\">filed a lawsuit against the company</a> in March this year claiming it had abandoned its founding mission of developing super-powerful AI to “benefit humanity,” and was instead enriching Microsoft.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Sutskever’s departure leaves just one of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openai-bizarre-structure-4-people-the-power-to-fire-sam-altman/\">four OpenAI board members</a> who voted for Altman’s ouster with a role at the company. Adam D’Angelo, an early Facebook employee and CEO of Q&amp;A site Quora, was the only existing member of the board to remain as a director when Altman returned as CEO.</p></div><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/openais-chief-ai-wizard-ilya-sutskever-is-leaving-the-company/\">Source link </a>"

Google’s newest AI updates are a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-end-of-google-search/\">seismic shift</a> for its core product.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE kJoQGV caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd cDlTYw iXWezO caption__text\"><p>New contextual awareness abilities help Google Search deliver more relevant results.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd jTWYmb fNaHcW caption__credit\">Courtesy of Google</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Some new capabilities include AI-organized search, which allows for more tightly presented and readable search results, as well as the ability to get better responses from longer queries and searches with photos.</p><p class=\"paywall\">We also saw AI overviews, which are short summaries that pool information from multiple sources to answer the question you entered in the search box. These summaries appear at the top of the results so you don’t even need to go to a website to get the answers you’re seeking. These overviews are already controversial, with publishers and websites fearing that a Google search that answers questions without the user needing to click any links may <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/13/google-ai-search-io-sge/\">spell doom</a> for sites that already have to go to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24117976/best-printer-2024-home-use-office-use-labels-school-homework\">extreme lengths</a> to show up in Google’s search results in the first place. Nonetheless, these newly enhanced AI overviews are rolling out to everyone in the US starting today.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A new feature called Multi-Step Reasoning lets you find several layers of information about a topic when you’re searching for things with some contextual depth. Google used planning a trip as an example, showing how searching in Maps can help find hotels and set transit itineraries. It then went on to suggest restaurants and help with meal planning for the trip. You can deepen the search by looking for specific types of cuisine or vegetarian options. All of this info is presented to you in an organized way.</p><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE kJoQGV caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd cDlTYw iXWezO caption__text\"><p>Advanced visual search in Lens.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd jTWYmb fNaHcW caption__credit\">Courtesy of Google</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Lastly, we saw a quick demo of how users can rely on Google Lens to answer questions about whatever they’re pointing their camera at. (Yes, this sounds similar to what Project Astra does, but these capabilities are being built into Lens in a slightly different way.) The demo showed a woman trying to get a “broken” turntable to work, but Google identified that the record player’s tonearm simply needed adjusting, and it presented her with a few options for video- and text-based instructions on how to do just that. It even properly identified the make and model of the turntable through the camera.</p><p class=\"paywall\">WIRED’s Lauren Goode talked with Google head of search Liz Reid about <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-end-of-google-search/\">all the AI updates</a> coming to Google Search, and what it means for the internet as a whole.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Security and Safety</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"AssetEmbedAssetContainer-eJxoAx dBHGoQ asset-embed__asset-container\"><span class=\"SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset\"><picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image\"><noscript><img alt=\"Image may contain Text Business Card Paper and White Board\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eybHBd fptoWY responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screenshot%25202024-05-14%2520at%252011.33.04%25E2%2580%25AFAM.png\" srcset=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_120,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_240,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_320,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_640,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_960,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_1280,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6643ae6c6b140351b78e423f/master/w_1600,c_limit/Screenshot%202024-05-14%20at%2011.33.04%E2%80%AFAM.png 1600w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/></noscript></picture></span></div><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE kJoQGV caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd cDlTYw iXWezO caption__text\"><p>Scam Detection in action.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd jTWYmb fNaHcW caption__credit\">Photograph: Julian Chokkattu</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">One of the last noteworthy things we saw in the keynote was a new scam detection feature for Android, which can listen in on your phone calls and detect any language that sounds like something a scammer would use, like asking you to move money into a different account. If it hears you getting duped, it’ll interrupt the call and give you an onscreen prompt suggesting that you hang up. Google says the feature works on the device, so your phone calls don’t go into the cloud for analysis, making the feature more private.

Motor and diesel fuel consumption in the US transportation sector accounted for nearly a third of the country’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions last year, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The tariffs reflect the US government’s unfortunate bind: It hopes to rev up sustainable energy sources while tamping down on imports from a country that happens to produce sustainable energy sources very well.</p><aside aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"PullQuoteEmbedWrapper-sc-EoVjf kgVYDs\"><div class=\"PullQuoteEmbedContent-sc-kTcfhx TuFxw\"><p class=\"paywall\">“The clock started 10 years ago, and we’re behind. We’re way behind.”</p></div><p><span class=\"paywall\">John Helveston, George Washington University</span></p></aside><p class=\"paywall\">The tariffs are also meant to start the clock on the US’s own domestic electric vehicle development, which will need more and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/zhidou-rainbow-ev-costs-just-dollar4400/\">cheaper electric cars</a>, but also the batteries and battery supply chains to make them go.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Or, maybe not start it. “The clock started 10 years ago, and we’re behind. We’re way behind,” says John Helveston, an assistant professor in engineering management and systems engineering at George Washington University who studies electric vehicle development and policy. The tariffs, he says, will not insulate the US against competition from Chinese cars forever. “They’re not going to make us better at making things.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Will the effort work? In a written statement, John Bozzella, president and CEO of the US’s main auto lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, was sanguine: “US automakers can outcompete and out innovate anyone on the EV transition,” he said. “No doubt about that. The issue at this moment isn’t the will … the issue is time.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">But even with more time, the future will be complicated. Automakers and auto suppliers selling in the US will have to figure out how to stay afloat even as they continue to pour billions into electric vehicle and battery development. And while US electric vehicle sales are going up, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/electric-vehicle-market-growth-sales-slump/\">their growth has slowed</a>.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Meanwhile, another influential US policy, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/cleanenergy/inflation-reduction-act-guidebook/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a>, directs billions to building up domestic supply chains for electric vehicles and other renewable energy sources. But those efforts could take years.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“The administration is trying to walk a line,” says Susan Helper, a professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University, who worked on electric vehicle policy in the Biden administration. “One goal is a strong auto industry with good jobs and clean production methods, and the other is fast action on climate change. In the long-term, they're consistent with each other. In the short term, there's conflict.”</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/new-ev-china-tariffs-biden/\">Source link </a>"

The 1984 concert film was shot over the course of four performances at Los Angeles’ iconic Pantages Theatre, and made independently on a budget of just over $1 million, which David Byrne and company raised on their own. What makes it so memorable (in addition to Byrne’s iconic oversize suit) is the simplicity with which it is shot, allowing the band’s creativity to take center stage and lead audiences on an unforgettable journey that feels as much like a piece of performance art as it does a straightforward concert.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Mad Max</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/caHnaRq8Qlg\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Before you watch Anya Taylor-Joy take over the role of Imperator Furiosa, a badass emancipator who dares to challenge gender conventions in a postapocalyptic world, take a look back at the film that started it all. It’s very likely that even writer-director George Miller didn’t know what he was igniting with <em>Mad Max</em>. Mel Gibson stars as Max Rockatansky, a kind of police officer (in dystopian dramas, authorities aren’t so clearly defined) who is seeking revenge from a biker gang after the brutal murder of his wife and child. In the 45 years since, the film has morphed into a full-on franchise with its fifth film, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em>, set to premiere later this month, and another one in development. You can watch all of the released films—1981’s <em>The Road Warrior</em>, 1985’s <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em>, and 2015’s <em>Fury Road</em>—on Max now, too.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CQFdGfwChtw\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">If you’re a fan of the absurdly dark work of Yorgos Lanthimos (<em>Poor Things</em>) and/or are just discovering the uncomfortable brilliance of Barry Keoghan, <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em> has got your name written all over it. Steven Murphy (Colin Farrell) is a highly esteemed surgeon with a loving wife (Nicole Kidman) and children whose life is turned upside down after he befriends Martin (Keoghan), an awkward teen who Steven learns lost his father a few years earlier. What begins as a seeming act of kindness on Steven’s part soon turns into a truly demented version of <em>Sophie’s Choice</em>. As always, Lanthimos’ ability to mix humor with pathos remains unmatched—perhaps never more so than here.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>The Zone of Interest</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-vfg3KkV54\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">In 1943, Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) was the commandant of Auschwitz who spent his days playing god with the lives of the concentration camp’s innocent prisoners. But what happened when Höss went home? That’s the reality Jonathan Glazer’s Oscar-winning film examines, and the answer is: Not much. Höss lives right next door to the camp, in the so-called Zone of Interest, with his wife Hedwig (Sandra Hüller) and their five children. Within those four walls, they strive to build a dream life for their family—while the sound of gunshots, incoming trains, and furnaces being lit are just a part of daily life. Yes, it’s every bit as brutal—and necessary—as it sounds.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Black Swan</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B7nU1RCkrnQ\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Natalie Portman gave what might very well end up being the defining performance of her career in this dark dance drama from Darren Aronofsky. Nina Sayers (Portman) is a dancer with the New York City Ballet whose entire life has been dedicated to her art, in large part due to her overprotective mother (Barbara Hershey), who was also a ballerina and pushes her daughter to have the career she wanted for herself. Nina’s life is turned upside down when she lands the lead in a new production of <em>Swan Lake</em>, only to realize that she’ll be splitting the part with the free-spirited Lily (Mila Kunis) who quickly becomes both the only friend Nina has ever really had and her most bitter rival. Soon, she descends into a dizzying madness that is reflected in Aronofsky’s directorial choices, which make the audience feel every bit of her emotions.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Good Time</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AVyGCxHZ_Ko\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Back in 2020, we named <em>Good Time</em> as one of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/most-underrated-movies-20-years\">most underrated movies of the past 20 years</a>, and absolutely still stand by that claim. Fortunately, as Robert Pattinson and the Safdie Brothers have continued to establish themselves as some of the most interesting actors (Pattinson and Benny Safdie) and directors (Benny again and his brother Josh) working today, more people have discovered the film, and even more will, now that it’s on Max. Connie Nikas (Pattinson) is a small-time criminal who is always looking for his next big score, and typically employs his developmentally disabled brother Nick (Safdie) as his partner. When a bank robbery goes wrong and Nick is nabbed by the police, Connie must fight for their survival. Much like <em>Uncut Gems</em>, which would later come to define the Safdies’ style, <em>Good Time</em> is a fast-moving, visceral crime thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat as Connie works to reunite with his brother, whatever the cost.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Wonka</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/otNh9bTjXWg\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Timothée Chalamet stars as Willy Wonka in this perfectly entertaining origin story of Roald Dahl’s quirky chocolatier, directed by <em>Paddington</em>’s Paul King.

But he’s a one-of-a-kind actor whose roles tend to fall into one of two categories: totally transcendent, or scenery-chewing at its most voracious. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/nicolas-cage-interview-artificial-intelligence-memes/\"><em>Dream Scenario</em></a> is very much the former, and has been heralded as one of the Oscar-winning actor’s best performances by some critics. Rightfully so. Cage stars as Paul Matthews, an unassuming biology professor who suddenly begins appearing in strangers’ dreams and achieves viral fame as a result of it. Like any good Cage performance, this one is multifaceted and examines the downside of sudden fame and what it really costs.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>The Green Knight</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sS6ksY8xWCY\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Writer-director David Lowery (<em>Pete’s Dragon</em>, <em>Peter Pan &amp; Wendy</em>) is a master of reimagining well-trodden material in ways that feel inventive and wholly new. That’s exactly what he did with this award-winning fantasy-adventure that sees Dev Patel in the role of Arthurian hero. Sir Gawain (Patel) is the nephew of King Arthur who has spent his life sheltered by his own privilege and decides it’s time to change that. So when the opportunity comes for Gawain to prove himself as a warrior befitting of his seat at the Round Table, he takes it—despite being woefully unprepared for the challenges that will come his way.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Dicks: The Musical</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SQDmT_Cih2Q\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">A24—the studio known for its edgy, award-winning indies like <em>Moonlight</em> and <em>Ex Machina</em> (which are both streaming on Max)—takes a dive into the musical genre with this adaptation of the off-Broadway hit <em>Fucking Identical Twins</em> (and you thought <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/dicks-the-musical-a24-hollywood-strike/\"><em>Dicks: The Musical</em></a> was a raunchy title). Aaron Jackson and Josh Sharp cowrote and costar in this over-the-top musical as two coworkers who discover that they’re long-lost twin brothers, and they attempt to <em>Parent Trap</em> their parents (played by Nathan Lane and Megan Mullally). Megan Thee Stallion plays their boss. Anyone offended by an f-bomb—or dozens of them—might want to give this one a skip.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Barbie</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pBk4NYhWNMM\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Greta Gerwig is a master of breathing new life into old properties (see: <em>Little Women</em>). With <em>Barbie</em>, she has ignited a revolution. Barbie (Margot Robbie) is living her best life in Barbieland—until one day, when her perfectly plastic world, and heels, suddenly begin to collapse. To get her fabulous life back, Barbie must travel to the real world—well, Los Angeles—to determine who or what is causing her existential crisis. The film has grossed nearly $1.5 billion worldwide, meaning you likely may have already seen it. But even if you did, it’s absolutely worth a second watch—if only to lament its many Oscar snubs.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Fargo</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ju75Sd4yAZw\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Frances McDormand won her first of four (and counting) Oscars for her role as Marge Gunderson, the extremely pregnant and no-nonsense chief of police in Brainerd, Minnesota. When a mysterious crime scene puts Marge on the trail of a car salesman (William H. Macy) with a terrible plan for getting his hands on a boatload of cash, it also puts Marge in the crosshairs of a couple of career thieves (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) with little regard for human life. As is often the case in any Coen brothers movie, there’s a perfectly balanced mix of very bad things and very funny moments, which somehow makes seeing a murderer attempt to dispose of a body in a wood chipper a laugh-out-loud moment.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"300px\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WCN5JJY_wiA\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Sergio Leone is the undisputed master of spaghetti Westerns, and <em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em> is his masterpiece. A mysterious stranger (Clint Eastwood) decides to partner up with a Mexican outlaw (Eli Wallach), but their kinship is not what it seems. With its clever twists, superb acting, and unforgettable score by Ennio Morricone, the film is a classic for a very good reason.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Eastern Promises</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gAhz9OnL8Ps\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Come for David Cronenberg’s iconic style, stay for Viggo Mortensen’s naked ass-kicking. Nikolai (Mortensen) is a strongman for one of the most ruthless crime families in London. But when a well-meaning midwife (Naomi Watts) comes around, asking questions about the death of a woman who may or may not be connected to Nikolai’s employers, he finds himself at a crossroads. The film is more action-packed than a typical Cronenberg film, which tend to lean toward the side of “bizarre,” and is all the more compelling because of it.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>RoboCop</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IqvRDhW-XVA\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">From <em>Total Recall</em> to <em>Showgirls</em> and back to <em>Basic Instinct</em>, director Paul Verhoeven has a track record almost unmatched in modern cinema. <em>RoboCop</em>, his dystopian take on law enforcement, is proof. Set in a bleak vision of Detroit overrun with crime, it follows a cop (Peter Weller) who gets fatally wounded and turned into, yes, a robot cop, who you might think is good at fighting crime, but of course is not. Some of the visual effects may look a little beat up now, but in 1987, they looked like the future. Also, if <em>RoboCop</em> leaves you wanting more, the film’s two sequels and 2014 reboot—none of which, sadly, were directed by Verhoeven—are also available on Max.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x8X44NRltMM\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">In reality, a great many of the <em>Star Trek</em> films are now on Max, but it’s <em>Wrath of Khan</em> that you need to watch before it leaves the streaming service. The movie that gave a kick in the teeth to the whole franchise and paved the way for <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, it’s the one held up as <em>the</em> Trek film. J. J.

He intended for H. R. Giger to do character designs, and Pink Floyd to make the soundtrack. He wanted Salvador Dalí to play a role. He had an outline for the film, at one point, that would have come in at around 14 hours. As you might imagine, this movie ultimately never came to pass, but director Frank Pavich’s documentary about Jodorowsky’s efforts is a masterpiece all its own.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Albert Brooks: Defending My Life</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L5pRaWnClyo\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Albert Brooks is a comedian’s comedian. Though he might be best known as the filmmaker behind such celebrated comedies as <em>Defending Your Life</em>, <em>Lost in America</em>, <em>Real Life</em>, and <em>Mother</em>, he’s also a brilliant actor (with an Oscar nomination to prove it). Brooks’ longtime pal Rob Reiner directs this charming documentary, which documents Brooks’ one-of-a-kind talent, with a stunning lineup of A-listers—including David Letterman, Steven Spielberg, Sarah Silverman, Judd Apatow, Chris Rock, Larry David, and Ben Stiller—all ready to sing his praises.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Dune</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hzUlXEyvJeA\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> is one of those iconic novels that several directors have attempted to bring to the screen and ended up abandoning. Nearly 40 years before Denis Villeneuve won six Oscars for <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-dune-legacy/\">his 2021 adaptation</a> of the classic sci-fi novel (which is also streaming on Max—and you should <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-sci-fi-movies-of-all-time-streaming/\">absolutely watch it</a>, along with its sequel, which arrives on May 21), David Lynch gave it a go—and the results <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/masterpiece-in-disarray-david-lynchs-dune-an-oral-history-excerpt/\">weren’t as admired at the time</a>. But Lynch’s <em>Dune</em> has experienced a bit of a critical reappraisal in recent years, particularly for what we now know to be its very Lynchian style. (Back then, it just seemed strange and surreal.) The film, which is set in the year 10191, sees the fate of the planet Arrakis—and its supply of melange, a unique spice and the most valuable substance in the universe—in the hands of young Paul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), the untested son of a powerful duke.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Furious 7</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Skpu5HaVkOc\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">You’d be forgiven for thinking a lot of the <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> movies start to run together. Car chase, fistfight, street race, big booms, Corona, “family”—the end. But this one is special. For starters, it’s the one where the gang parachutes a bunch of souped-up cars out of the back of a cargo plane. For another, it marks Paul Walker’s final appearance in a <em>Fast</em> movie. (He died in a car accident in 2013.) It’s a bittersweet film, and also one of the franchise’s best.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Carrie</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YuO26oJQLVs?start=1s\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Four directors have attempted to mine Stephen King’s debut novel for cinematic inspiration, which ultimately seems pointless after Brian De Palma’s 1976 original. Nearly 50 years after its debut, the film still manages to scare the pants off audiences. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy, sheltered, and, yeah, kinda weird teen who is a favorite target of her high school’s clique of mean girls. When one of said mean girls (Nancy Allen) is barred from attending her own senior prom because of her behavior, she and her boyfriend make a plan to get revenge on poor ol’ Carrie. But Carrie has the last laugh when, after being doused by a bucket full of pig’s blood, she shows a gymnasium full of prom-goers why her “Creepy Carrie” nickname is well earned. The film also features an ending that can still make audiences quite literally jump out of their seats.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Pulp Fiction</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s7EdQ4FqbhY\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">If you're a movie buff, chances are you've already seen Quentin Tarantino's seminal <em>Pulp Fiction</em>. But, if you're a movie buff, you're also probably the kind of person who likes to revisit it often. But be warned: If you think this might inspire you to indulge in a Tarantino marathon, you're out of luck. It's one of the only Tarantino flicks on Max. (This depends a lot on whether you count the director's appearance in <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em>.) Still, enjoy your time with Jules and Vincent (and Honey Bunny and the gimp and Marsellus Wallace and Butch) while you can.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d9MyW72ELq0\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">James Cameron’s <em>Avatar</em> sequel felt like a movie centuries in the making. In reality, just over a dozen years passed between the original 2009 movie and last year’s <em>The Way of Water</em>. That timeline adds up: The second in a scheduled series of five films takes place 16 years after the events of the original and catches up with Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldana)—now married with children, and still blue. Though the movie didn’t seem to make as loud a splash as its predecessor, it managed to wipe Cameron’s own <em>Titanic</em> out of the water—plus all the <em>Star Wars</em> movies—to become the third-highest-grossing movie of all time (with <em>Avatar</em> in the top spot, followed by <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>).</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Reality</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/plIUJ-LF7JU\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">In 2017, an intelligence report about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election was leaked anonymously.

HBO’s reigning muse, Sydney Sweeney (<em>Euphoria</em>, <em>The White Lotus</em>), shines in this gripping true story, which plays out mostly in real time as the FBI knocks on the 25-year-old’s door and spends more than an hour questioning her.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Parasite</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/isOGD_7hNIY\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Even if you don’t care about awards, the fact that <em>Parasite</em> is the first—and still only—non-English-language movie to win a Best Picture Oscar should tell you something about the universality of its themes. The Kims, a family struggling to make ends meet, set their scheming sights on the Parks, a well-to-do family with plenty of problems of their own, but also plenty of money to muffle their dysfunction. At least for a time. Just when you think you know how class warfare is playing out in this black comedy, it changes course to reach an unexpected conclusion. As always, Bong Joon-ho knows just how to lead his audience down one path, only to open a trapdoor into another.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>All the Beauty and the Bloodshed</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YD5pYQiT1D4\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Finding success in one’s lifetime might seem like the dream of every artist, but Nan Goldin has bigger ambitions. Though she’s a photographer by trade, she’s an activist by calling and has long used her camera to capture painfully intimate moments of America in crisis, including extensive work focused on the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics. But <em>All the Beauty and the Bloodshed</em> reveals the artist in conflict: Should she allow her work to be showcased in one of the prominent museums or galleries that have received endowments from the Sackler family—the Big Pharma family that many blame for America’s opioid crisis? It’s a moving portrait of an artist willing to risk it all for her beliefs.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>The Dark Knight</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EXeTwQWrcwY\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">First things first: All three of Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are currently on Max, and binge-watching all of them in a row is certainly one way to spend an evening. But if you’re opting to watch just one, the second film in the series is the one to beat. Though Christian Bale’s Caped Crusader gets top billing, it’s Heath Ledger’s now-iconic performance as the Joker that makes <em>The Dark Knight</em> the most compulsively watchable Batman movie (even beyond Nolan’s entries). Though Ledger tragically passed away six months before the film’s release, he posthumously won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his villainous turn, in which he managed to find the perfect balance between dark humor and outright insanity.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\"><em>Hereditary</em></h2><figure data-testid=\"IframeEmbed\" class=\"IframeEmbedWrapper-sc-dRedg kSrFfN iframe-embed\"><div data-testid=\"IframeEmbedContainer\" class=\"IframeEmbedContainer-hptgUZ hFGDtL\"><p><iframe class=\"IframeEmbedContent-cMdiev csnuAY IframeEmbedContent\" height=\"113\" width=\"200\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-same-origin\" title=\"Embedded Frame\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V6wWKNij_1M\" allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; clipboard-write; autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\"></iframe></p></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">Ari Aster made a splash—and one memorable splat—with his directorial debut, which took psychological horror to new heights. Annie Graham (Toni Collette) is a miniature artist living a seemingly contented life with her psychiatrist husband (Gabriel Byrne) and their two teenagers, Peter (Alex Wolff) and Charlie (Milly Shapiro). But any sense of normalcy disappears almost immediately following the death of Annie’s mom, with whom she had a challenging relationship. Is Annie crazy? Is her husband a terrible shrink? Is Peter a terrible person? Why does Charlie make that clicking noise? What’s that in the back seat of the car? These are all valid questions that are answered by Aster, whose deft directorial style has made him an instant Hollywood icon. Aster’s follow-up film, 2019’s equally disturbing <em>Midsommar</em>, is also available to stream.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/best-movies-hbo-max-right-now/\">Source link </a>"

The so-called crypto mining process requires large amounts of energy for computing and cooling data processing centers, which perform complex math equations in order to secure cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.</p><p>Elsewhere in the world, cryptocurrency miners have recently come under increased scrutiny for their electricity-sapping operations, and for the impact their activity has on power grids and carbon emissions.</p><p>In 2021, El Salvador became the first country to adopt bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar which it adopted two decades earlier. The bitcoin move earned Nayib's government harsh criticism for its embrace of the volatile cryptocurrency, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Cryptocurrency miners Foundry USA, Ant pool, ViaBTC, F2Pool and Binance Pool pooled their resources to win a reward for opening a blockchain that can verify the last three years of bitcoin transactions originating from the power plant, according to the government Bitcoin Office.</p><p>(Reporting by Nelson Renteria; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Aurora Ellis)</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/el-salvador-mined-nearly-474-232132781.html\">Source link </a>"

(Reid has been at Google a mere 20 years, where she has worked on a variety of search products.) Her AI-soaked demo was part of a broader theme throughout Google’s keynote, led primarily by CEO Sundar Pichai: AI is now underpinning nearly every product at Google, and the company only plans to accelerate that shift.</p><p class=\"paywall\">“In the era of Gemini we think we can make a dramatic amount of improvements to search,” Reid said in an interview with WIRED ahead of the event, referring to the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-gemini-generative-ai-boom/\">flagship generative AI model</a> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-rebrands-ai-chatbot-gemini/\">launched late last year</a>. “People’s time is valuable, right?

Also: The screenplay was written by AI.</p><p class=\"paywall\">These changes to Google Search have been long in the making. Last year the company carved out a section of its Search Labs, which lets users try experimental new features, for something called <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-hands-on-with-google-searchs-answer-to-chatgpt/\">Search Generative Experience</a>. The big question since has been whether, or when, those features would become a permanent part of Google Search. The answer is, well, now.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Google's search overhaul comes at a time when critics are becoming increasingly vocal about what feels to some like a <a data-offer-url=\"https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/25/how-i-search-in-2024/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/25/how-i-search-in-2024/&quot;}\" href=\"https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/25/how-i-search-in-2024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">degraded search experience</a>, and for the first time in a long time, the company is feeling the heat of competition, from the massive mashup between <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-emerges-as-the-winner-in-openai-chaos/\">Microsoft and OpenAI</a>. Smaller startups like <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/founder-perplexity-ai-sundar-pichai-competing-to-reinvent-search/\">Perplexity</a>, You.com, and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/brave-browser-search/\">Brave</a> have also been riding the generative AI wave and getting attention, if not significant mindshare yet, for the way they’ve rejiggered the whole concept of search.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Automatic Answers</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Google says it has made a customized version of its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-gemini-generative-ai-boom/\">Gemini AI model</a> for these new Search features, though it declined to share any information about the size of this model, its speeds, or the guardrails it has put in place around the technology.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This search-specific spin on Gemini will power at least a few different elements of the new Google Search. AI Overviews, which Google has already been experimenting with in its labs, is likely the most significant. AI-generated summaries will now appear at the top of search results.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One example from WIRED’s testing: In response to the query “Where is the best place for me to see the northern lights?” Google will, instead of listing web pages, tell you in authoritative text that the best places to see the northern lights, aka the aurora borealis, are in the Arctic Circle in places with minimal light pollution. It will also offer a link to NordicVisitor.com. But then the AI continues yapping on below that, saying “Other places to see the northern lights include Russia and Canada’s northwest territories.”</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-end-of-google-search/\">Source link </a>"

Some newer crypto tokens with artificial intelligence (AI) connections are still buoyant, and some of them are up more than 132% for the year.</p><p>A big reason for that has been the enormous enthusiasm around the <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/terms/a/artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=379e4fe8-0c9e-4f15-8a2a-7618358ab497\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:artificial intelligence;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">artificial intelligence</a> investment thesis. In the same way that equity investors have embraced <strong>Nvidia</strong> (NASDAQ: NVDA), crypto investors are now embracing new crypto tokens they think could benefit the most from AI. With that in mind, here's a closer look at three of the most popular AI crypto tokens that have been seeing the biggest boosts lately.</p><h2>Render</h2><p>Arguably, the most popular AI crypto token is <strong>Render</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(CRYPTO: RNDR)</span> -- it's up 132% for the year. With a total market cap of $4.5 billion, Render now ranks as a top 25 cryptocurrency. Given its recent ascent, some investors now refer to Render as \"the Nvidia of crypto.\" As you might have guessed from the name, Render offers GPU-based rendering solutions for studios, artists, and creators.</p><p>But that's not why crypto investors are so excited about Render. The thinking now is that the same decentralized <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/gpu-stocks/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=379e4fe8-0c9e-4f15-8a2a-7618358ab497\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:GPU computing power;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">GPU computing power</a> used for rendering can also be used for AI. If you want to train a large language model (LLM), for example, you will need a lot of \"GPU compute,\" which is the raw computing power required for modern AI solutions.</p><p>So it's easy to see why Render's performance is starting to look a lot like Nvidia's (which has become nearly synonymous with all things AI). Nvidia is the ultimate source of all that GPU-based computing power, whether it's used for rendering or AI.</p><h2>Fetch.ai</h2><p><strong>Fetch.ai</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(CRYPTO: FET)</span> is up a staggering 208% for the year and now ranks as a top 50 crypto by market cap. Fetch.ai is building what it refers to as an \"open, permissionless, decentralized machine learning network with a crypto economy.\" That's a mouthful, but it just means that Fetch.ai is a new platform for AI products and services. That includes large data sets for training LLMs and sophisticated AI bots known as agents.</p><p>The way that you pay for these AI products and services is with the Fetch.ai token. You can think of Fetch.ai as a digital currency for the emerging AI economy. Thus, the greater the demand for all things AI, the greater the demand for the Fetch.ai token.</p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><div class=\"caas-figure-with-pb\" style=\"max-height: 540px\"><div><div class=\"caas-img-container caas-img-loader\" style=\"padding-bottom:56%\"><img class=\"caas-img caas-lazy has-preview\" alt=\"AI computer chip.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xB4OFCTWrbANwSiA5O2Qmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/e67268b040c7940c058923c247bc353a\"/><noscript><img alt=\"AI computer chip.\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xB4OFCTWrbANwSiA5O2Qmg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motleyfool.com/e67268b040c7940c058923c247bc353a\" class=\"caas-img\"/></noscript></div></div></div><p><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">Image source: Getty Images.</figcaption></p></figure><p>While there is obviously some demand for AI on a consumer level (who hasn't played around with AI chatbots?), the real demand will come from companies looking to undergo AI transformations. That's where Nvidia comes into the picture because these companies are often using Nvidia's products for new AI-related projects.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>According to Fetch.ai, the highest growth opportunities are in sectors such as logistics, transportation, and smart energy grids. As proof of its growing industry focus, Fetch.ai recently partnered with German companies <strong>Bosch</strong> and <strong>Deutsche Telekom</strong> on an AI platform.</p><p>Since 2017, Bosch has partnered with Nvidia on AI-powered self-driving cars, so that could be just one example of an area where Fetch.ai gets a huge boost. In the past, Deutsche Telekom has partnered with Nvidia on \"smart city\" concepts, so that might be another area.</p><h2>SingularityNET</h2><p>Finally, there's <strong>SingularityNET</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(CRYPTO: AGIX)</span>, which is up an eye-popping 193% for the year. It now ranks as a top 75 cryptocurrency, with a $1.2 billion market cap. However, since it's not available for trading on popular cryptocurrency exchanges such as <strong>Coinbase Global</strong> <span class=\"ticker\">(NASDAQ: COIN)</span>, it may not be suitable for all crypto investors.</p><p>In terms of overall AI strategy, SingularityNET is hitting it out of the park. It is pushing forward the idea of artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is leaps and bounds ahead of the current version of AI, known as generative AI (best known as the variety that includes ChatGPT).</p><p>In fact, according to futurists like Ray Kurzweil (now at Google), AGI implies a future in which a single computer will be smarter than all humans combined. It will have access to all human knowledge ever created and, as a result, will be able to create truly innovative solutions. To power that level of AI, it will probably require a lot of Nvidia GPUs.</p><h2>What's next for AI crypto tokens?</h2><p>As long as Nvidia's stock performance continues to impress, it's safe to say that investors will be on the lookout for crypto tokens most likely to benefit from the enthusiasm around AI. For investors who think that Nvidia is the one AI stock they need to own, then it also makes sense to focus on AI crypto tokens with indirect or direct ties to Nvidia.</p><p>However, just keep in mind that AI is still a relatively new industry, and trends can come and go. Plenty of companies claim to be \"the next Nvidia,\" so it's likely the AI investment thesis will change and evolve over time. For now, though, the three crypto tokens highlighted above appear to be doing the best job of benefiting from the new enthusiasm around AI.</p><h2>Should you invest $1,000 in Bitcoin right now?</h2><p>Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:</p><p>The <em>Motley Fool Stock Advisor</em> analyst team just identified what they believe are the <strong><a href=\"https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&amp;impression=65764386-49ef-41b9-b0a3-9d937f261c46&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-foolcom-sa-bbn-dyn%3Faid%3D8867%26amp%253Bsource%3Disaeditxt0010895%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D13885&amp;utm_source=yahoo-host-full&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;referring_guid=379e4fe8-0c9e-4f15-8a2a-7618358ab497\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:10 best stocks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">10 best stocks</a></strong> for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn’t one of them.

This wasn’t surprising: While Maiman touted the potential scientific applications of his discovery when he first unveiled it to the country later that year, the laser immediately conjured up visions in the public consciousness of the Martian “heat ray” from H. G. Wells’ <em>War of the Worlds</em>, so much so that many of the contemporary headlines from its debut were variations of the <em>Los Angeles Herald</em>’s “L.A. Man Discovers Science Fiction Death Ray,” <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=2ggTSh0PRDoC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;dq=%22L.A.+Man+Discovers+Science+Fiction+Death+Ray.%22%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NTbuzvLN9r&amp;sig=ACfU3U0_PbQz0BLG2VeF8N3Iw7DzN5IopQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjkxqzEqtyFAxUrL0QIHaErAVAQ6AF6BAglEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22L.A.%20Man%20Discovers%20Science%20Fiction%20Death%20Ray.%22%22&amp;f=false\">according</a> to Jeff Hecht’s book <em>Beam: The Race to Make the Laser</em>. “In reality, the laser was more of a Life Ray than a Death Ray,” Maiman would later <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Laser_Inventor/bjxEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=maiman+laser&amp;printsec=frontcover\">recall thinking</a> of his invention’s medical applications, according to his memoir.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The Pentagon began exploring the military applications of lasers almost immediately, from relatively practical uses like <a data-offer-url=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/0999lasers/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/0999lasers/&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/0999lasers/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">designators for laser-guided bombs</a> to more far-fetched concepts like the Strategic Defense Initiative of the 1980s, also known as “Star Wars.” But only in the past few decades has the underlying technology advanced to the point where laser weapons are effective against their intended targets.</p><p class=\"paywall\">In the mid-2000s, the Air Force successfully used its <a href=\"https://www.aftc.af.mil/News/On-This-Day-in-Test-History/Article-Display-Test-History/Article/2462050/february-3-2010-testing-of-yal-1-airborne-laser-test-bed/\">Boeing 747-based YAL-1 airborne laser</a> to defeat ballistic missiles in flight during tests, while the <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/science/laser-equipped-humvee-pops-and-fizzles-ieds/\">Army’s Humvee-mounted Zeus-HMMWV Laser Ordnance Neutralization System system</a> deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq to zap landmines, improvised explosive devices, and unexploded ordnance.

Investors forgetting their intricate passwords is a primary reason, but loss of access to two-factor authentication devices, unexpected shutdowns of cryptocurrency exchanges and cyberattacks are also common.</p><p>Wallet passwords are usually alphanumeric and the wallet provider also offers a set of randomized words, known as \"seed phrases\", for additional security - both these are known only to the user. If investors lose the passwords and phrases, access to their wallets is cut off.</p><p>With bitcoin prices regaining traction since last October and hitting a record high of $73,803.25 in March, investors seem to be suffering from a classic case of FOMO, or the fear of missing out.</p><p>Reuters spoke to nearly a dozen retail investors who had lost access to their crypto wallets. Six of them contacted a recovery services firm and managed to regain access to their holdings.</p><p>\"What would be driving this trend is the fact that bitcoin prices are at $60,000, not $30,000... it's just pure economics,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.</p><p>\"People who are missing their crypto for one reason or another, or those who don't have access to their crypto, are very much incentivized to get it back.\"</p><p>The world's largest cryptocurrency has surged 161% in the past two quarters, on hopes of a cut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve and optimism around the launch of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</p><p>BOOM IN RECOVERY REQUESTS</p><p>A Switzerland-based firm that uses Nvidia's graphic processing unit cards to run artificial intelligence models to access stranded wallets saw requests jump tenfold in the first quarter, compared with the year-ago period.</p><p>\"We have seen a spike (in requests to unlock wallets) every time the price changes dramatically,\" said a top executive at the firm who did not want to be named.</p><p>ReWallet, a Germany-based wallet recovery services provider, saw a 334% jump in requests in the previous quarter and logged a record-high number of requests in early March, when bitcoin prices touched an all-time peak.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>The firm estimates that about 20% of the total 19 million bitcoins in circulation, as of March 13, are likely inactive and now worth around $237 billion.</p><p>U.S.-based Wallet Recovery Services saw a 30% bump in requests this year as of mid-April.</p><p>Recovery services provided by firms do not come cheap. ReWallet and WRS charge a 20% fee on the wallets' contents, with the caveat being they get paid only upon retrieval.</p><p>INVESTORS' WALLET RECOVERY ATTEMPTS</p><p>\"I was simply worried that I would no longer have access (to my wallet) and thus lose my bitcoins forever,\" said an investor living in Germany, who declined to be named. \"Of course, the high bitcoin price was an incentive to finally tackle this.\"</p><p>Another Switzerland-based investor, who also requested anonymity, said, \"I had secured the wallet with passphrases and couldn't remember it. I tried again and again and created various lists with possible alternatives, but unfortunately without success.\"</p><p>Recounting ReWallet's retrieval of his bitcoin holdings, now worth over $300,000, he said, \"It was an indescribably great feeling. I'm retiring in one-and-a-half years and I now feel financially well positioned.\"</p><p>Speaking about investors' struggles, Ralf Wintergerst, chief executive of German security technology firm Giesecke+Devrient said, \"Looking ahead, there is a growing trend towards solutions that mitigate the key management problem inherent in self-custody.\" \"This could entail the use of multi-signature wallets, or other decentralized recovery mechanisms to distribute responsibility and enhance security.\"</p><p>(Reporting by Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wallet-recovery-firms-buzz-locked-120803950.html\">Source link </a>"

After all, who needs to devote precious real estate to a device whose purpose is merely to tell you your weight? The “smart scale” category sprung to life in the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/04/wahoo-scale/\">early days</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/internet-of-things-what-is-explained-iot/\">internet of things</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wiredinsider/2013/03/fitbits-smart-scale/\">early models</a> weren’t always the best, hampered by connectivity issues and general usability problems. As such, the category has largely stagnated; only a handful of companies are now making the devices, and some haven’t updated their product line in years.</p><p>Only recently has that started to change, as newer, faster, and all-around better products have begun to hit the market again. Not only can newer smart scales track a bevy of health metrics for multiple members of your household via sophisticated mobile apps, but they’ve also ironed out all the kinks, so it’s easier than ever to track your weight.</p><p>Just how smart can a scale be? And which should you buy? If an accurate weight is what’s most important to you, don’t sweat the decision too much. All of these scales I've tested are quite accurate. My highest and lowest weight never varied by more than 0.6 pounds across all of them—that means getting one of the cheaper models will suffice. But if you’re serious about weight loss or physical training, you’ll probably want to get further into the weeds and consider the accuracy of the additional body metrics, the wireless format, and the overall usability and robustness of the hardware and software. It’s here where I’ve spent the bulk of my testing time to find the best smart scale. With all that in mind, I have some thoughts.</p><native-ad position=\"in-content\" shoulddisplaylabel=\"true\"/><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"AssetEmbedAssetContainer-eJxoAx dBHGoQ asset-embed__asset-container\"><span class=\"SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset\"><picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image\"><noscript><img alt=\"Image may contain Screen Electronics Projection Screen and White Board\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eybHBd fptoWY responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/divider-guides.png\" srcset=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_120,c_limit/divider-guides.png 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_240,c_limit/divider-guides.png 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_320,c_limit/divider-guides.png 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_640,c_limit/divider-guides.png 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_960,c_limit/divider-guides.png 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_1280,c_limit/divider-guides.png 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/60ef147e5d7882c40c51f6b1/master/w_1600,c_limit/divider-guides.png 1600w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/></noscript></picture></span></div></figure><h2>How Do Smart Scales Work?</h2><p>Smart scales come in two basic flavors: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The former connects directly to your phone to sync its readings. The latter uses your home’s wireless network to sync readings straight to the cloud, which your phone’s app can then access. Wi-Fi scales are more expensive but more versatile. While older scales often featured erratic wireless connections, newer models have had many of their kinks worked out—and firmware updates have improved connectivity.</p><p>Virtually all smart scales use the same type of system to gauge your additional vitals: bioelectrical impedance analysis, which involves sending a minuscule electric current up one leg and measuring what happens when it comes down the other side. Some mathematical magic converts all of this into any number of derived measurements about things like your body’s percentage of fat, water, and bone; body-mass index; and, sometimes, arcana like your basal metabolic rate, a measure of your body’s energy consumption at rest. All the scales I tested can sync data with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-apple-watch-is-now-the-control-center-for-your-health/\">Apple Health</a> and Google Fit or <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-use-google-health-connect/\">Health Connect</a>, either directly or by passing data via the app.</p><p><em>Special offer for Gear readers: <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/v2/offers/wir203?source=Site_0_HCL_WIR_EDIT_HARDCODED_0_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE_ZZ)\"><strong>Get</strong></a></em> <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/v2/offers/wir203?source=Site_0_HCL_WIR_EDIT_HARDCODED_0_COMMERCE_AFFILIATE_ZZ)\"><strong>WIRED <em>for just $5 ($25 off)</em></strong></a><em>.

However, the deal has sparked controversy among Stack Overflow's user community, with many <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/399619/our-partnership-with-openai\">expressing anger</a> and protest over the use of their contributed content to support and train AI models.</p>\n\n<p>\"I hate this. I'm just going to delete/deface my answers one by one,\" <a href=\"https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/399619/our-partnership-with-openai#comment1333537_399619\">wrote</a> one user on sister site Stack Exchange. \"I don't care if this is against your silly policies, because as this announcement shows, your policies can change at a whim without prior consultation of your stakeholders. You don't care about your users, I don't care about you.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> is a popular question-and-answer site for software developers that allows users to ask and answer technical questions related to coding. The site has a large community of developers who contribute knowledge and expertise to help others solve programming problems. Over the past decade, Stack Overflow has become a heavily utilized resource for many developers seeking solutions to common coding challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Under the announced partnership, OpenAI will utilize Stack Overflow's <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/api-solutions/\">OverflowAPI</a> product to improve its AI models using content from the Stack Overflow community—officially incorporating information that many believe it had previously scraped without a license. OpenAI will also \"surface validated technical knowledge from Stack Overflow directly into ChatGPT, giving users easy access to trusted, attributed, accurate, and highly technical knowledge and code backed by the millions of developers that have contributed to the Stack Overflow platform for 15 years,\" according to Stack Overflow.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">In return, OpenAI plans to provide attribution to the Stack Overflow community within ChatGPT, but how the company will do that exactly is unclear. Stack Overflow will also use OpenAI technology in its development of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.co/teams/ai/?utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_campaign=teams_search_brand_ai&amp;_bt=689119161077&amp;_bk=overflowai&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6PGxBhCVARIsAIumnWZsKT3FnJ_gY-nooRL5c_xnb0NekS2ZkENj-l_31OA9wtQlUrUcj0oaAp5oEALw_wcB\">OverflowAI</a>, an AI model announced in July 2023 that uses an LLM to provide answers to developer questions.</p>                                            <aside class=\"ad_wrapper\" aria-label=\"In Content advertisement\">\n    <span class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </span>    \n        \n</aside>\n                                                        \n\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">While the companies tout the collaboration's benefits, many Stack Overflow users have expressed their displeasure with the deal. This is especially true considering that until very recently, Stack Overflow seemed to take a negative stance toward generative AI in general, <a href=\"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/policy-generative-ai-e-g-chatgpt-is-banned\">banning answers written using ChatGPT</a>. It was also <a href=\"https://observablehq.com/@ayhanfuat/the-fall-of-stack-overflow\">widely reported</a> last year that ChatGPT's popularity had severely reduced Stack Overflow's traffic, though the company seemed to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/08/08/insights-into-stack-overflows-traffic/\">later refute</a> that, claiming faulty analysis by outsiders.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Since the announcement, some users have attempted to alter or delete their Stack Overflow posts in protest, arguing that the move steals the labor of those who contributed to the platform without a way to opt out. In retaliation, Stack Overflow staff have reportedly been banning those users while erasing or reverting the protest posts. On Monday, a Stack Overflow user named Ben <a href=\"https://m.benui.ca/@ben/112396505994216742\">took to Mastodon</a> to share his experience of getting suspended after posting a protest message:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Stack Overflow announced that they are partnering with OpenAI, so I tried to delete my highest-rated answers.</p>\n<p>Stack Overflow does not let you delete questions that have accepted answers and many upvotes because it would remove knowledge from the community.</p>\n<p>So instead I changed my highest-rated answers to a protest message.</p>\n<p>Within an hour mods had changed the questions back and suspended my account for 7 days.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">Stack Overflow moderators have stated that once posts are made, they become \"part of the collective efforts\" of other contributors and should only be removed under extraordinary circumstances, according to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151906/stack-overflow-ai-protest-posts-deleted-restored\">The Verge</a>. Stack Overflow's <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/legal/terms-of-service/public#licensing:~:text=This%20means%20that%20you%20cannot%20revoke%20permission%20for%20Stack%20Overflow\">terms of service</a> also state that users cannot revoke permission for Stack Overflow to use their contributed content.</p>\n<p>While Stack Overflow owns user posts, the site uses a Creative Commons 4.0 license that requires attribution. We'll see if the ChatGPT integrations, which have not rolled out yet, will honor that license to the satisfaction of disgruntled Stack Overflow users. For now, the battle continues.</p>\n\n                                                </div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/stack-overflow-users-sabotage-their-posts-after-openai-deal/\">Source link </a>"

Hoskinson was a member of the founding team of ethereum before leaving to focus on developing a new<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/what-is-blockchain?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:blockchain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"> blockchain</a> called <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/cardano-price-prediction?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cardano;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Cardano</a>. The blockchain prioritizes creating social change by providing use cases that will benefit society.</p><p><strong>Don't Miss:</strong></p><p>Hoskinson started a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1lPJqbobyDlxb\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:broadcast on X;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">broadcast on X</a> on May 9 to discuss \"Biden and crypto.\" He promptly criticized the Biden administration, accusing it of actively seeking to \"destroy the American cryptocurrency industry,\" and framing \"a vote for Biden is a vote against the industry.\"</p><p>The comments came after a veto from Biden on a recent resolution. The SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) was up for debate in Congress, as a majority was hoping to reject the proposal to ease restrictions on bank's ability to interact with cryptocurrency.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38733156/house-challenges-sec-over-crypto-custody-rules-biden-vows-blockade?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:The proposal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">The proposal</a> would force banks to report digital tokens held for customers on their balance sheets. This could arguably lead to huge increases in accounting costs, which could deter some banks from offering digital assets.</p><p><strong>Trending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ,<a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/money/kraken?utm_campaign=partner_feed&amp;utm_source=yahooFinance&amp;utm_medium=partner_feed&amp;utm_content=site\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:how much would $10 get you today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"> <strong>how much would $10 get you today</strong></a>?</strong></p><p>However, the rejection is expected to be ineffective, as the Biden administration has vowed to veto it, allowing the SEC to continue its work aimed at protecting investors in crypto-asset markets and safeguarding the broader financial system. The Biden administration goes on to say that SAB 121 was \"issued in response to demonstrated technological, legal, and regulatory risks that have caused substantial losses to consumers.\"</p><p>Hoskinson believes that the SEC is overstepping their bounds and is using largely outdated regulations to argue for its position. \"The Securities Exchange Act passed in 1933, to say that it is sufficient to regulate assets that came 90 years later is an absurd statement,\" Hoskinson added.</p><p>He went on to say that other countries, such as Singapore and Switzerland, have been much more welcoming to crypto, which has brought in huge amounts of investment and provided a boost to their economies. Additionally, he noted that many of the companies that are currently operating in other countries likely would have been operating \"in the United States had our crypto policy been reasonable.\"</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>When asked about Trump, he noted that, while the [Trump] administration had its issues, it mostly ignored our industry. \"The Biden administration has engaged in a coordinated effort to kill crypto.\"</p><p>As the November election approaches, the cryptocurrency industry could unexpectedly become an important topic for many voters. It will be interesting to see how the candidates continue to evolve their stances and how voters respond.</p><p><strong>Read Next:</strong></p><figure class=\"caas-figure\"><p><figcaption class=\"caption-collapse\">crypto digital assets</figcaption></p></figure><p>\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news &amp; everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - <a href=\"https://pro.benzinga.com/register/?utm_source=yahoo_finance\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!</a></p><p>Get the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?</p><p>This article <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/05/38841071/cardano-founder-charles-hoskinson-accuses-biden-administration-of-attempting-to-kill-crypt\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Accuses Biden Administration Of Attempting To 'Kill Crypto';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Accuses Biden Administration Of Attempting To 'Kill Crypto'</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.benzinga.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Benzinga.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Benzinga.com</a></p><p><i>© 2024 Benzinga.com.

The sounds of spring are here, so you know what that means: Google I/O is blooming.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Hot on the heels of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ipad-pro-ipad-air-2024-everthing-apple-announced/\">iPad launch event</a> last week, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/google/\">Google</a> is going all out for its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/io/\">I/O</a> developer conference on Tuesday, May 14. The event is taking place at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California, just down the road from Google's headquarters. The keynote starts at 10 am PDT on Tuesday, and as usual, it will be livestreamed. Expect to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/live/google-io-2024-liveblog/\">hear and see updates</a> about Android 15, Google search, the already announced <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-pixel-8a/\">Pixel 8A</a> budget phone, and just an absolute torrent of news about the tech topic of the decade: artificial intelligence.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Watch This Space</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Google’s keynote address, which should open with remarks from Pichai before the team rolls out all the new stuff, starts <strong>Tuesday, May 14,</strong> at <strong>10 am PDT</strong> (1 pm EDT). You can watch it on Google’s <a data-offer-url=\"https://io.google/2024/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://io.google/2024/&quot;}\" href=\"https://io.google/2024/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">I/O website</a> or on Google’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/XEzRZ35urlk?si=iCNrPsERgc_Bb1KS\">YouTube channel</a>. The videofeed is also embedded right here at the top of this page.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Tune in on our <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/live/google-io-2024-liveblog/\">Google I/O live blog</a>, where WIRED's team in attendance will be offering up-to-the-minute news updates and analysis of all the announcements.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Beyond the main keynote, there’s a subsequent <a data-offer-url=\"https://io.google/2024/explore/af9317b5-1c42-471a-99db-1bc8108d06a8/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://io.google/2024/explore/af9317b5-1c42-471a-99db-1bc8108d06a8/&quot;}\" href=\"https://io.google/2024/explore/af9317b5-1c42-471a-99db-1bc8108d06a8/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">developer-focused keynote</a> starting at 1:30 pm PDT (4:30 EDT), viewable using the same links as the first stream.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">AI All the Way Down</h2><p class=\"paywall\">While Google's <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/google-gemini/\">Gemini AI</a> platform has experienced some <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-gemini-woke-ai-image-generation/\">growing pains</a>, the company is still eager to put its generative AI offerings into any and all of its services: search, its photo and video tools, and its workspace suite of tools like Gmail and Google Docs. Google has also been slowly <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-assistant-multi-modal-upgrade-bard-generative-ai/\">infusing AI features</a> into its Google Assistant, so it will be interesting to see whether those new capabilities result in a more evolved form of natural-language voice assistant, or more of a true <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-tested-next-gen-ai-assistant/\">AI assistant</a> that acts as an agent to perform tasks through all your connected services.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The company will, of course, show off features from its upcoming <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/android/\">Android 15</a> mobile operating system, more in-car integration through Android Auto, and its smartwatch software <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/wearos/\">Wear OS</a>. Expect each of those to be newly endowed with all sorts of exciting (and maybe slightly creepy) AI-powered features.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Google’s AI announcements could also offer a hint at whatever news Apple might have in store for its <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/wwdc/\">WWDC</a> developer conference keynote, which will take place June 10. Just a couple months ago, news trickled out that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/apple-in-talks-to-license-google-gemini-for-iphone-ios-18-generative-ai-tools\">Apple may be working with Google</a> to wrangle the latter's Gemini AI platform into iOS. Neither company has officially confirmed the news, and it’s not entirely clear what such an uneasy partnership between the two mobile heavyweights <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-google-gemini-iphone/\">might look like</a> on the iPhone. Google’s presumably AI-heavy keynote announcements could provide a hint at whatever is being cooked up on Apple devices.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Hard Where?</h2><p class=\"paywall\">I/O is a software-focused event, but that hasn’t stopped Google from using the keynote to announce new hardware devices in the past. If the dearth of recent leaks about the company’s ambitions are any indicator, this year may be slimmer on the hardware front that I/Os past.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Generally speaking, Google is usually pretty unbothered about keeping its new gadgets under wraps before a big public event. Details about its upcoming <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-pixel-8a/\">Pixel 8A</a> phone <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141503/google-pixel-8a-leaked-specs-security-updates\">leaked</a> a couple weeks ago, but Google officially announced the device last week. (The phone goes on sale on May 14, the same day as I/O.) Google will probably talk about its new Pixel on the block, and how it will utilize Android 15 and Gemini AI.</p><p class=\"paywall\">It’s always possible that another device might appear. Google announced its first <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-fold/\">Pixel Fold</a> at I/O <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-pixel-fold/\">last year</a>, and that’s probably due for an upgrade at some point, but we aren't expecting that to come this month. Google has also been keeping quiet about any new augmented reality tech it's working on, though it has shown concepts like Project Starline and language-translating smart glasses at past I/O events. We really expect that with so much attention being paid to artificial intelligence development, Google will likely make its AI announcements the star of the show.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-io-2024-how-to-watch-what-to-expect/\">Source link </a>"

Instead, politics got in the way, with the campaign of a renegade group of Republican representatives pushing for a new speaker, along with a slew of spending bills and global crises, delaying the historic ballot for almost a year.</p><p>That is set to change next week when the full House plans to vote on the market structure bill, known as FIT21, which now counts House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) as a cosponsor and includes a number of new provisions, including specifications for when a cryptocurrency should be <a href=\"https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/05/01/sec-ethereum-consensys-hinman-gensler-security/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:treated;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">treated</a> as a security. Yesterday, I caught up with Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.)—the chair of the subcommittee on digital assets and a <a href=\"https://punchbowl.news/article/finance/economy/french-hill-house-financial-services-committee-chair/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:candidate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">candidate</a> to take over the full committee when McHenry retires this year—to find out whether FIT21 has any chance of becoming a law.</p><p>The House already has a strong base of crypto-sympathetic representatives, including <a href=\"https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/26/ritchie-torres-cryptocurrency-blockchain-web3-financial-inclusion/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Ritchie Torres;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Ritchie Torres</a> (D-N.Y.), who have voted in favor of a number of bills, including a recent one to repeal an unpopular SEC guidance that will likely <a href=\"https://blockchaintipsheet.com/news/tornado-cash-developer/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:go before;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">go before</a> the Senate today or tomorrow. The Senate is a different matter, with stalwarts including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) staking a firm position against digital assets. So while FIT21 will likely make it out of the House, it will face a roadblock in the upper chamber.</p><p>\"I don't think we take any legislative strategy off the table,\" Hill told me, arguing that FIT21 could become part of other authorizing bills that come to Congress, like the farm bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, or spending bills during the lame-duck session after the elections in November. While the Senate has done more recent work on stablecoin legislation, Hill said that FIT21 more adequately addresses how financial regulators should treat crypto. \"I think this could all come together in an effective way,\" he told <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>Despite the optimism, any ambitious bill not targeting TikTok faces steep odds of passing both chambers. Even with bipartisan excitement over a recent stablecoin agreement in the Senate last month, talks <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/04/30/stablecoin-bill-unlikely-to-get-pinned-to-faa-reauthorization-putting-effort-on-hold-again/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:fizzled;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">fizzled</a>, and McHenry and House Financial Services Committee ranking member Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) have yet to reach an accord in the House, which is why only FIT21 is being advanced of the two bills that were voted out of committee last July. While a successful floor vote next week—Hill said likely Wednesday or Thursday—will be a symbolic victory, it is unlikely to lead to actual legislation.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Instead, crypto is increasingly becoming a partisan flashpoint, with former President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/10/trump-crypto-biden-00157051\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:announcing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">announcing</a> his embrace of the sector at an event last week.

This was the first such alert issued by the agency in nearly 20 years.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Visible auroras are possible across much of the United States as a result of this expected storm. An event of this magnitude is also likely to cause disruptions to radios, satellites, and possibly even some power grids, though nothing most people should be concerned about.</p><p class=\"paywall\">This weekend’s aurora potential started with a sunspot more than 10 times larger than Earth. It’s a sunspot so large, in fact, that it’s <a data-offer-url=\"https://twitter.com/wxdam/status/1788955746870214836\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/wxdam/status/1788955746870214836&quot;}\" href=\"https://twitter.com/wxdam/status/1788955746870214836\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">visible to the unmagnified eye</a> through a leftover pair of eclipse glasses.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Solar flares and CMEs are often associated with sunspots. Larger and more intense spots can lead to more frequent and more intense releases of matter from the sun’s atmosphere.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Satellites dedicated to tracking solar activity detected the first CME rushing out of the sun’s corona around 9:00 am EDT on May 8. A second, smaller CME erupted from the same region a few hours later, followed by another burst of charged matter about eight hours after that.</p><p class=\"paywall\">All three CMEs erupted with different intensities and speeds. The first CME was the largest and slowest of the trio, which allowed the second, faster CME to collide and merge into the first. The third CME of the bunch would eventually catch up as well, allowing all three surges of charged particles to reach Earth in a single wave about 60 hours after ejecting from the sun.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The combined intensity of the three CMEs washing over Earth’s atmosphere at once is the driving force behind the severe geomagnetic storm.</p><p class=\"paywall\">If everything stays on track, a memorable series of auroras could grace the skies over much of the United States during the overnight hours Friday into early Saturday morning.</p><p class=\"paywall\">The timing of the event places the likely peak disruption in the middle of the night across the US, providing a great viewing opportunity for most of the country if the event remains on course.</p><p class=\"paywall\">A geomagnetic storm of this intensity could make the aurora visible overhead from Seattle to Chicago to New York and Washington, DC, with auroras possible as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina. Colors may be visible on the northern horizon as far south as northern Florida.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Folks across Europe and Asia may also see the auroras if the storm arrives during their nighttime hours. During the peak of an event of this magnitude, the northern lights could dance overhead around London, Paris, Berlin, and Moscow.</p></div><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/geomagnetic-storm-aurora-night-sky/\">Source link </a>"

Casascius coins.</p><p>“I've never sold any. I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage,” Otoh told CoinDesk in an interview, discussing his recent auction of over 200 worth of physical bitcoins in what was the Heritage auction firm’s <a href=\"http://www.otoh.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:first crypto sale;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">first crypto sale</a>.</p><p>Casascius coins, created by Mike Caldwell (who went by Casascius, an acronym for “call a spade a spade,” on Bitcoin forums), were a solution to spending bitcoin in face-to-face transactions by embedding a Bitcoin private key in a metal coin.</p><p>The last ones were made in 2013 after the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network told Caldwell that he was <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/13/bitcoin-mint-casascius-shut-down-by-us-regulators/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:operating an unlicensed money transmitter business;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">operating an unlicensed money transmitter business</a>.

In some sense, these coins are the most long lived and recognizable image of the purely a digital currency.</p><p>“It seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go,” Otoh said. “Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.”</p><p>Of course, part of the danger of bringing bitcoin into the physical realm is that it makes the assets as easy to steal as a $20 note from mom’s purse – and unfortunately, Otoh thinks he was the victim of a theft about a decade ago. He recounted a story of receiving a shipment of coins where the box had been obviously tampered with.</p><p>The 55 BTC missing from his collection were worth about $20,000 at the time they were purchased, and are now worth about $3.5 million, “which is a huge sum in most anyone's book,” he said. “I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me,” he added.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p><i><b>See also: </b></i><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/13/why-for-some-crypto-is-the-defining-political-issue-of-our-times/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"><i><b>Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times</b></i></a><i><b> | Opinion</b></i></p><p>CoinDesk caught up with Otoh ahead of Consensus to discuss his recent auction of vintage physical bitcoins, early investments in other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum’s initial coin offering and how he manages his wealth by diversifying into properties around the world and residing in a tax haven in the British Channel Islands.</p><p><b>Could you give a sense of what you’re talking about at Consensus?</b></p><p>I’m on the panel about physical bitcoins. I'm basically a fill-in for Mike Caldwell, who invented Casascius coins, who couldn't make it unfortunately.</p><p><b>Oh, that's so cool.</b></p><p>Would be nice to meet him one day. Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee asked if I'd be a substitute for the gap on the panel because I am a large investor.</p><p><b>Do you remember buying your first coin?</b></p><p>Yes, very much. It was at the London Bitcoin Conference in 2012. I had just started on bitcoin in the summer of 2011, around July. I remember at the time I met with some German guys – there were all these privacy advocates wearing masks who had a whole bunch of physical coins to sell. I believe it was 10 regular bitcoins and a 10 bitcoin unit piece. The price at the time, with the premium and everything, was $12 a bitcoin.</p><p><b>What does Otoh stand for?</b></p><p>It’s an acronym for “on the other hand.” That's how it's usually used. I just adopted it because I find myself, a lot of the time, not necessarily being argumentative but looking at different viewpoints. I thought bitcoin and crypto is also a different way of looking at finance. Nearly everyone had a nickname on the BitcoinTalk forum. That's the way that came about, but I didn't give it much thought at the time. It was just the first thing that came into my head.</p><p><b>Are there any particular memories of the early days of Bitcoin that you remember fondly?</b></p><p>Fondly? Yes, that must be getting my first coin – that was a big deal. At the time people were still giving away free coins. By the time I joined, word had spread, and it often wasn't a full coin anymore, just a fraction of a coin, but it was still fun to have my own address and then be sent this little token amount of coins to see how it could function.</p><p>At the time I was traveling between Europe and the States quite a bit and also buying and selling in Europe and the States. With bitcoin, it suddenly became really easy to send money.</p><p>A few of the other memories are more traumatic. It's very easy to mess up. As you learn as you go.</p><p><b>You've probably lost more bitcoins than most people have today.</b></p><p>If you count the ones that were stolen off me. Like that list I just gave you that I put together from nine years ago. Somewhere out there there is a lost, stolen treasure of a few million dollars.</p><p><b>What do you suspect happened there? A rogue employee?</b></p><p>I think it is most likely a rogue U.S. Postal Service employee who just used a box cutter and saw something that looked promising. He probably thought it was Gold Eagles or Silver Eagles or something. I don't know what the reaction would be, whether they were disgusted to see it was just some weird tokens and threw them away or whether they thought “Oh, this looks cool.”</p><p>I’ve always hoped that I’d have a brainstorm and remember if I’ve stashed them away somewhere. But it doesn't make any sense – I've got everything else very well looked after and itemized. A friend of mine whose house I had been staying in at that time remembers receiving a box that was cut open and resealed.</p><p><b>Is there anything that you want to say about the OTOH Collection of Physical Cryptocurrency?</b></p><p>Well, after a decade, I decided it's time to sell. I've never sold any, I’ve just been accumulating them as my version of a cold storage. Now that I've sold all my digital crypto, it seemed the right time to let some of the physical coins go. Let other people look after them and enjoy having them.</p><p><b>You're also a real estate investor. At this point, do you think it’s better for people to invest in bitcoin or physical property?</b></p><p>I think it’s a mixture of the two. Bitcoin is high-risk, but potentially it has very high returns. And property is a hedge. It's a safety net. It's also very hard to steal, whereas bitcoins can be very easy to steal.</p><p>If I was still in my 20s, then I'd probably be keeping a much higher percentage in crypto, but nowadays I like the security of having a bunch of properties and enjoy renovating them.</p><p><b>Are you interested in other digital assets?</b></p><p>In the past I pretty much have been. I was the largest holder of litecoin {{LTC}} when it was a few cents. I think I had roughly 600,000. It was the first altcoin, and was quite controversial with Bitcoin Maximalists. They disliked it intensely because they thought it withdrew funds and interest away from Bitcoin. But I was quite convinced from the first time I saw it, it's impossible for anything to exist without its opposite.</p><p>And so that paid out very well. After Litecoin, I moved into Dash and was the largest holder of those and helped develop the project in some ways. And then I kind of lost interest and moved onto other things. I was highly recommended Ethereum at a Dutch conference and participated in the ICO. I got 100 bitcoins worth, which was about 10,000 Ethereum. Unfortunately, I sold those way too soon. I made 100% or 200% profit, but I sold them for something like $2. So I will rue the potential $800 million there. Otherwise I'm pretty much fully bitcoin nowadays.</p><p><b>The way you discussed bitcoin earlier in the conversation you discussed it mostly as a method of transaction. Are you convinced by the arguments that it has properties like gold?</b></p><p>I think it is excellent as an investment. I think that's its main use at the moment. It’s perhaps the best performing investment in history, and it continues to grow. It is a trillion dollar asset class, and a great way to store value. Satoshi viewed it in the beginning as a hedge against the degenerate behavior of central governments and banks abusing the currencies that we will have to use every day. It's much more versatile than gold, in that it can be transferred pretty much anywhere around the world from anyone to anyone, instantly, with no armored trucks or anything and next to no fees. It's quite miraculous really, that it's come into existence. It's still very early days, but it really has transformed the world in many many ways.</p><p><b>What have been your biggest purchases made with crypto?</b></p><p>I must admit I've done very little with buying and selling with crypto. I go from fiat currency into crypto and then back out to fiat currency.</p><p><b>Capital gains taxes make spending crypto sort of annoying, to some extent.</b></p><p>For many people it would, yes. I'm fortunate that I am based in a tax haven where there isn't any capital gains tax. I make sure that I'm physically there when I cash any out. So I don't have that issue. There's also no income tax.</p><p><b>You mentioned you have a home in California. How do you balance the tax situation there, where state tax authorities may want to charge you income tax?</b></p><p>I’ve got homes in many countries around the world; it doesn't mean I'm suddenly a tax resident. I make sure I count my days very carefully – I don’t overstay. As long as I'm not here for more than six months of the year, I won't be liable for any tax. And I don't do any business here.</p><p><b>Do you mind if I ask what tax haven?</b></p><p>It’s a little island in the British Channel Islands called Sark. It’s a three square mile island and fairly unique in the world for having next to no tax. You just pay a small proportion of your property tax as a contribution to the kind of upkeep of the island. The main thing about it that's attractive is you don't have to keep records of what you're doing, which would have been hugely complicated when I was converting altcoins into bitcoin and then into other alternative currencies and then back into dollars. I do not pity the people who had to try and keep these records and then present them to a tax authority.</p><p><b>Did you give up your passport?</b></p><p>No, I still keep a U.K. passport. I could trade it in for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernsey\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Guernsey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Guernsey</a> passport, which is the main island in the channel. It's really just a clone of the U.K.. It has all the same benefits, but I haven't bothered to do it. It doesn't really matter what nationality I have. It really only matters where I'm a fiscal resident.</p><p><b>How would you describe your political views?</b></p><p>Well, like many people, with age I probably have become a little more conservative in some ways. But I'm pretty much a capitalist; I believe that's a good way for people to behave. I'm not overtly political. I was probably quite anarchist in the past. I just adapt to whatever the majority believes. I am not trying to change things myself in a big way – I’m pretty apolitical.</p><p><b>Is there anything more you want to say about the possible theft of those Casascius coins?</b></p><p>I believe it was 55 bitcoins in value, something like $3.5 million at present value. At the time they were lost or taken they were only worth about $13,000. Still a lot but nothing compared to right now. So I'm very happy to offer a half a million dollar reward for their return. And unconditionally, I wouldn't want to press charges if someone decided to give them back to me.</p><p><i><b>See also: </b></i><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/video/spot-bitcoin-etfs-what-you-need-to-know/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"><i><b>Spot Bitcoin ETFs: What You Need to Know</b></i></a></p><p>One day, I expect they'll turn up unless they've gone on a destructive route somehow. Everyone can see the addresses; I was really surprised when I checked a couple of weeks ago that they had never been moved and that they hadn't been peeled. So they're probably out there somewhere.</p><p><b>Last question, what are you looking forward to at Consensus?</b></p><p>Well, meeting Bobby Lee and Charlie Lee again. They both in their own ways have been very instrumental in helping me with my crypto journey. Charlie Lee by inventing Litecoin, where I did extremely well – probably even better than I did with bitcoin. And Bobby Lee for having BTCC (also known as BTCChina) and the physical coins. He produced physical coins just like Mike's Casascius coins. I have still got all my BTCC coins. That will be a future auction.</p><p>I've had quite a few adventures with the physical coins. I had to physically go to Shanghai to pick them up, as they couldn't be shipped at the time. That was an adventure in itself.</p><p>There's other people that I know from forums and interacting with on the internet who I'm sure it would be nice to see again in person if I've met them at other conferences. It's a chance to put people together and exchange ideas that if one just sat behind a computer at home, perhaps wouldn't happen.</p><p>So I'm looking forward to it. It's quite exciting. It's my first visit to Texas.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-old-head-otoh-talks-140208433.html\">Source link </a>"

Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hades-review/\">first <em>Hades</em></a>, where gamers play as the underworld’s prince, fighting his way out of the depths of hell, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hades-2-early-access-launch-release-date/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Hades II</em></a> hands the weapons over to the underworld’s princess, Melinoë, who must fight her way <em>further into</em> the depths to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time.</p><p class=\"paywall\">As fans of <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hades-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Hades</em></a>, we were stoked to play the <a data-offer-url=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/&quot;}\" href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">early access version</a> of this game. Even though the developers are still working to improve <em>Hades II</em> and add more content, it might already be the best game we’ve played so far this year. (And, yes, that even includes <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/balatro-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Balatro</em></a>.)</p><p class=\"paywall\">While it’s currently available only on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-gaming-desktop-pcs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PC</a>, the game is expected to be on consoles for <a data-offer-url=\"https://www.supergiantgames.com/\" class=\"external-link\" data-event-click=\"{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.supergiantgames.com/&quot;}\" href=\"https://www.supergiantgames.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supergiant’s full release</a>, likely sometime in 2025. After playing the opening hours of <em>Hades II</em>, we have some advice for beginners who are about to embark on their next journey into the underworld.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Definitely Use a Controller</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Even though there’s a giant notice on the opening screen of <em>Hades II</em> stating that a controller is recommended for the best experience, we were confident that our keyboard skills would be sufficient to fight our way down to Chronos. Wrong! After 30 minutes of playing (and not doing great), we switched over to a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ps5-dual-sense-controller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PlayStation DualSense controller</a>, and the game immediately clicked.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Understand the Arcana System</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The witchy themes are such a delightful addition for <em>Hades II</em>, but to be honest it took us a second to grasp the revamped power-up system. As you’re fighting your way through the different chambers, make sure to collect plenty of <strong>Ashes</strong> and <strong>Psyche</strong>. Then, use these to gain abilities and power-ups that stick around for every run attempt. The Ashes will unlock new <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-tarot-card-apps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">arcana cards</a> for you to pick from, and the Psyche points will allow you to use more cards at a time.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Slow Down Time</h2><p class=\"paywall\">One of the first Arcana cards that you’ll unlock is called The Sorceress—lean on this ability to get through the game’s opening section. With The Sorceress, whenever you use the Omega variant for one of your combat abilities, you slow down time for two seconds. Although that doesn’t <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-these-nobel-winning-physicists-explored-tiny-glimpses-of-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sound like much time</a>, this gives you an extra moment to dodge and aim better.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Catch Enemies With a Cast</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The earliest enemies we struggled with were these monsters that aggressively chase you around with a screaming attack. It’s frustrating to dash away unsuccessfully, and they sent us back to the starting location multiple times. In addition to slowing down time, you can try to avoid their attack by using your cast power often to create a large area where enemies are temporarily stuck and vulnerable to attacks.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Gather Absolutely Everything</h2><p class=\"paywall\">The ability to gather items on your runs is a cool new feature added for <em>Hades II</em>. Whether it’s a deathcap mushroom or a lotus flower, most of what you can pick by hand is useful for crafting special recipes in the cauldron at the home base. Though, some of the items require tools to gather. For example, you might want to unlock the <strong>Crescent Pick</strong> to mine the Silver that sometimes appears.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Be Friendly and Generous</h2><p class=\"paywall\">This strategy will be familiar to <em>Hades</em> players, and it remains true for the second game. Yes, nailing the combat is critical, but talking to every NPC you encounter is also important. In the spirit of generosity, offer them <strong>Nectar</strong>. In addition to improving your relationship to the character, they might return the favor and give you a keepsake with different bonuses.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Toggle God Mode</h2><p class=\"paywall\">Are you having a tough time on your journey to defeat Chronos and just want to follow the rest of the <em>Hades II</em> story? Is there a boss fight that you’ve had enough of, and you’re ready to move on to the next challenge? You can toggle God Mode anytime you want from the Pause screen to become impervious to damage. Simply select <strong>Options</strong> and enable it under <strong>Gameplay.</strong></p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Just Play <em>Hades</em></h2><p class=\"paywall\">OK, hear us out. If you haven’t already played the original game, you might really enjoy going back to <em>Hades</em>. Plus, if you don’t have access to a PC, it’s available on consoles. We’ve been replaying the game on <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/nintendo-switch-oled/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nintendo Switch</a> for months, and it’s just as awesome as it was back in 2020.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Are you a Supergiant superfan who’s eager to play the early release version of <em>Hades II</em>? You'll likely have a blast playing either game, as long as you keep in mind that the early access option is still unfinished. New to the franchise? Although the second game will still be quite fun and approachable without playing the first one, you might have an even better time playing <em>Hades</em> now and diving into the sequel after the developers polish it up and add more content with the complete release.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/hades-2-best-tips-beginners/\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p>The fourth Bitcoin halving in April reduced the new bitcoin issuance rate to 3.125 BTC every ten minutes, sparking significant interest and speculation. Since then, Bitcoin has been down from its highs, with some investors concerned that the days of higher BTC prices are in the distant future.</p><p>We believe March’s new high (above $70,000) was a \"head fake\" driven by new spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, considering the halving event and ongoing supply/demand issues, we expect a brighter future for BTC and crypto as the year progresses.</p><p><b>You're reading</b><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Crypto Long &amp; Short;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"><b> Crypto Long &amp; Short</b></a><b>, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor.</b><a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/crypto-long-short/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Sign up here;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"><b> Sign up here</b></a><b> to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.</b></p><p>Why do some pundits think Bitcoin has topped? And why did the selloff occur? Unlike past halvings, Bitcoin's price soared to a new high of $73,750 with a market cap of $1.44 trillion on March 14, a month before the halving. The rapid increase from the start of the year, when it was as low as $39,000, scared speculative investors and those in it for the \"halving trade,\" prompting them to cash out.</p><p>However, the retreat likely stemmed from macro factors, specifically hawkish comments by the Federal Reserve. These ignited a \"risk-off\" mentality as an interest rate cut became more unlikely in 2024, with a hike becoming possible. Since then, economic data has been weaker than expected, making a hike very unlikely for now. This shift has put the risk trade back on, setting an immediate floor in BTC prices, which have since recovered above $60,000. It also suggests a shift back to supply and demand factors for bitcoin, which appear favorable for higher prices.</p><p>There are several reasons to be bullish on Bitcoin and crypto.</p><p>First, the past three halvings have consistently led to new all-time highs in Bitcoin price in the months following the event. We believe this trend will accelerate as more institutional investors include BTC in their portfolios, further tightening the supply. This “rising tide\" in BTC should lift all crypto boats.</p><p>Second, the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 is a pivotal development. These ETFs, allowing investors to trade shares through existing retail brokerage accounts, promise wider availability through financial advisors. Firms such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and LPL are conducting due diligence on their platforms for availability. Approval on these platforms seems inevitable, enhancing accessibility and simplifying the investment process in Bitcoin, which will likely lead to much higher demand.</p><p><button class=\"link caas-button readmore-button-finance collapse-button readmore-button-class\" data-ylk=\"elm:readmore;slk:Story continues\"><span class=\"readmoreButtonText\">Story continues</span></button></p><p>Third, regulatory developments in the global crypto markets will significantly influence Bitcoin's price dynamics. The potential passage of a U.S. bill establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and Europe's <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-mica-and-what-does-it-mean-for-crypto-users-in-europe/#:~:text=MiCA%20regulations%20require%20crypto%20asset,about%20their%20EMTs%20or%20ARTs.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \"><u>Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation</u></a> is crucial. They will help dispel the notion that BTC and crypto are mere \"pet rocks,\" acknowledging them as stores of value with technological utility. This shift in perception can transform Bitcoin and crypto from speculative instruments to strategic investments and, potentially, a flight-to-quality investment.</p><p>Remember that a complex interplay of market dynamics, investor sentiment, technological advancements and macroeconomic events influences Bitcoin's price. I am bullish on BTC and crypto and will watch closely as the post-halving market continues.</p><p><i><b>Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.</b></i></p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/halving-impact-macro-shifts-create-154500072.html\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": " [ad_1]\n<br><div><p class=\"paywall\">The school bus is in many ways ideal for V2G. “There’s no uncertainty in terms of the use of the bus,” says Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez, director of the Renewable Energy and Advanced Mathematics Lab at UC San Diego, who studies the grid but wasn’t involved in the project. “Having that clarity on what the transportation needs are—that makes it much easier for the grid to know when they can make use of that asset.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Zum’s buses start operating at 6 or 6:30 am, drive kids to school, and finish up by 9 or 9:30 am. While the kids are in class—when there’s the most solar energy flowing into the grid—Zum’s buses plug into fast-chargers. The buses then unplug and drive the kids home in the afternoon. “They have large batteries, typically four to six times a Tesla battery, and they drive very few miles,” says Vivek Garg, cofounder and COO of Zum. “So there’s a lot of battery left by end of the day.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">After the kids are dropped off, the buses plug in again, just as demand is spiking on the grid. But instead of further increasing that demand by charging, the buses send their surplus power back to the grid. Once demand has waned, around 10 pm, the buses start charging, topping themselves up with electricity from nonsolar sources, so they’re ready to pick up kids in the morning. Zum’s system decides when to charge or discharge depending on the time of day, so the driver just has to plug in their bus and walk away.</p><p class=\"paywall\">On weekends, holidays, or over the summer, the buses will spend even more time sitting unused—a whole fleet of batteries that might otherwise be idle. Given the resources needed to make batteries and the need for more grid storage, it makes sense to use what batteries are available as much as possible. “It’s not like you’re placing a battery somewhere and then you’re only using them for energy,” says Garg. “You’re using that battery for transportation, and in the evening you’re using the same battery during the peak hour for stabilizing the grid.”</p><p class=\"paywall\">Get ready to see more of these electric buses—if your kid isn’t already riding in one. Between 2022 and 2026, the EPA’s <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/cleanschoolbus\">Clean School Bus Program</a> is providing $5 billion to swap out gas-powered school buses for zero-emission and low-emission ones. States like California are providing <a href=\"https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/zero-emission-school-bus-and-infrastructure-program\">additional funding</a> to make the switch.</p><p class=\"paywall\">One hurdle is the significant upfront cost for a school district, as an electric bus costs several times more than an old-school gas-guzzler. But if the bus can do V2G, the excess battery power at the end of the day can be traded as energy back to the grid during peak hours to offset the cost difference. “We have used the V2G revenue to bring this transportation cost at par with the diesel buses,” says Garg.</p><p class=\"paywall\">For the Oakland schools project, Zum has been working with the local utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, to pilot how this works in practice. PG&amp;E is testing out an adaptable system: Depending on the time of day and the supply and demand on the grid, a V2G participant pays a dynamic rate for energy use and gets paid based on the same dynamic rate for the energy they send back to the system. “Having a fleet of 74 buses—to be followed by other fleets, with more buses with Zum—is perfect for this, because we really want something that’s going to scale and make an impact,” says Rudi Halbright, product manager of vehicle-grid-integration pilots and analysis at PG&amp;E.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/these-electric-school-buses-are-on-their-way-to-save-the-grid/\">Source link </a>"

Also, they’re really fun. I’ve never met anyone who has tried an electric bicycle and <em>not</em> wanted one; in the Netherlands, electric bicycles currently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/01/bike-country-n0-1-dutch-electric-record-numbers-e-bikes-netherlands\">outsell regular bicycles</a>.

This surge was in response to the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which has implications for potential interest rate cuts in 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:According;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">According</a> to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index for April came in at 0.3%, which is lower than the expected rate of 0.4%. The March CPI print was 0.4%, which saw a lower rate of increase for the last twelve months ending April for the index, coming in at 3.4%. Rising shelter and gasoline costs were the main contributors, responsible for “over seventy percent of the monthly increase in the index for all items.”</p><p>Market participants immediately began discussing the possibility of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Currently, traders are betting on a June rate cut probability of just 3.1%. The market anticipates that the first possible rate cut would occur in September, with a 53% probability, <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">according</a> to the CME’s FedWatch tool.</p><p><em><strong>But how do rate cuts affect crypto prices? </strong></em></p><p><strong><em>Also Read: <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/rate-hikes-and-the-fed-how-do-they-affect-crypto-markets\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:Rate Hikes and the Fed – How Do They Affect Crypto Markets?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">Rate Hikes and the Fed – How Do They Affect Crypto Markets?</a></em></strong></p><p>Positive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have also played a role in boosting investor sentiment. On May 15, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of over $153 million, with Bitwise’s BITB leading the way, <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/?p=997\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:according;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\" class=\"link \">according</a> to Farside Investors. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has typically experienced outflows, surprisingly saw an inflow of $27 million. This comes after weeks of net outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with the decline in Bitcoin’s price from its all-time highs of $73,750, reached on March 14. Further institutional appetite for Bitcoin investment products continues to grow, as evidenced by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board's disclosure of holding approximately $164 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-price-surges-following-lower-073309485.html\">Source link </a>"

It lets you set specific layouts on screen for your windows to drop into, and these layouts can be saved for later use too, so you can switch between different configurations as needed.</p><p class=\"paywall\">Choose <strong>Launch layout editor</strong> from FancyZones settings and you're able to pick between different layouts for windows on the screen. You can stack windows in columns, for example, or have them in rows on top of each other, or keep them stacked in one corner of the screen. It's particularly handy for widescreen monitors, or when using multiple displays.</p><p class=\"paywall\">With FancyZones enabled and your preferred layout selected, just hold <strong>Shift</strong> while dragging a program’s window to drop it into a zone, where it will snap into position. You can even tweak zone colors, and the margins between the zones.</p><h2 class=\"paywall\">Keyboard Manager</h2><figure class=\"AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed\"><div class=\"AssetEmbedAssetContainer-eJxoAx dBHGoQ asset-embed__asset-container\"><span class=\"SpanWrapper-umhxW kGxnNB responsive-asset AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset\"><picture class=\"ResponsiveImagePicture-cWuUZO dUOtEa AssetEmbedResponsiveAsset-cXBNxi eCxVQK asset-embed__responsive-asset responsive-image\"><noscript><img alt=\"Windows 11 screenshot\" class=\"ResponsiveImageContainer-eybHBd fptoWY responsive-image__image\" src=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_120,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_240,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_320,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_640,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_960,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_1280,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/66441a8e13742ec334bcecd3/master/w_1600,c_limit/02-keyboard-manager.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"100vw\"/></noscript></picture></span></div><div class=\"CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE kJoQGV caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption\"><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionText-bHjzlu iUEiRd cDlTYw iXWezO caption__text\"><p>Use Keyboard Manager to remap keys and shortcuts.</p>\n</span><span class=\"BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd jTWYmb fNaHcW caption__credit\">Courtesy of David Nield</span></div></figure><p class=\"paywall\">If you feel a little bit limited by the keyboard customization options you get with Windows, give Keyboard Manager a go.

But, amid an unprecedented outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in US dairy cows, the risks have ratcheted up considerably. Health experts have stepped up warnings against drinking raw milk during the outbreak, the scope of which is still unknown.</p>\nYet, raw milk enthusiasts are undaunted by the heightened risk. The California-based Raw Milk Institute called the warnings \"<a href=\"https://www.rawmilkinstitute.org/updates/avian-flu-and-raw-milk-a-common-sense-approach\">clearly fearmongering</a>.\" The institute's founder, Mark McAfee, told the Los Angeles Times this weekend that his customers are, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-05-12/raw-milk-enthusiasts-uncowed-by-bird-flu-risk-in-dairy\">specifically requesting raw milk from H5N1-infected cows</a>. According to McAfee, his customers believe, without evidence, that directly drinking high levels of the avian influenza virus will give them immunity to the deadly pathogen.\n<p>Expert Michael Payne told the LA Times that the idea amounts to \"playing Russian roulette with your health.\" Payne, a researcher and dairy outreach coordinator at the Western Institute for Food Safety and Security at UC Davis, added, \"Deliberately trying to infect yourself with a known pathogen flies in the face of all medical knowledge and common sense.\"</p>\n<p>Much remains unknown about the biology of avian influenza in cattle. Until March 25, when the US Department of Agriculture confirmed the virus in a dairy herd in Texas, cattle were generally considered virtually resistant to H5N1. But since then, the USDA has tallied <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/livestock\">42 herds in nine states</a> that have contracted the virus. Epidemiological data so far suggests that there has been cow-to-cow transmission following a single spillover event and that the 42 outbreak herds are connected by the movement of cattle between farms.</p>                                            <aside class=\"ad_wrapper\" aria-label=\"In Content advertisement\">\n    <span class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </span>    \n        \n</aside>\n                                                        \n<p>The limited data on the cows so far suggests that the animals largely develop mild illness from the infection and recover in a few weeks. Their mammary glands are the primary target of the virus. <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.03.592326v1\">A preprint published earlier this month</a> found that cows' udders are rife with the molecular receptors that bird flu viruses latch onto to spark an infection. Moreover, the glands contain multiple types receptors, including ones targeted by human flu viruses as well as those targeted by bird flu viruses. Thus, dairy cows could potentially act as a mixing vessel for the different types of flu viruses to reassemble into new, outbreak-sparking variants.</p>\n<p>With the virus apparently having a field day in cows' udders, researchers have found raw milk to be brimming with high levels of H5N1 viral particles—and those particles appear readily capable of spilling over to other mammals. In a case study last month, researchers reported that a group of about two dozen farm cats developed severe illness after drinking milk from H5N1-infected cows. Some developed severe neurological symptoms. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/04/concerning-spread-of-bird-flu-from-cows-to-cats-suspected-in-texas/\">More than half the cats died in a matter of days</a>.</p>\n<h2>Deadly virus</h2>\n<p>Data on flu receptors in the two animals may explain the difference between cows and cats. While the cow's mammary gland had loads of multiple types of flu receptors, those receptors were less common in other parts of the cow, including the respiratory tract and brain. This may explain why they tend to have a mild infection. Cats, on the other hand, appear to have receptors more widely distributed, with infected cats showing viral invasion of the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1592682/pdf/JPATH168000176.pdf\">lungs, hearts, eyes, and brains</a>.</p>\n<p>Raw milk devotees—who claim without evidence that drinking raw milk provides health benefits over drinking pasteurized milk—dismiss the risk of exposure to H5N1. They confidently argue—also without evidence—that the human digestive system will destroy the virus. And they highlight that there is no documented evidence of a human ever becoming infected with H5N1 from drinking tainted milk.</p>                                            <aside class=\"ad_wrapper\" aria-label=\"In Content advertisement\">\n    <span class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </span>    \n        \n</aside>\n                                                        \n<p>The latter point on the lack of evidence of milkborne H5N1 transmission is true. However, the current outbreak is the first known spillover of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) to dairy cow mammary glands. As such, it presents the first known opportunity for such milk-based transmission to occur.</p>\n<p>Before pasteurization became routine for commercial milk production, raw milk was a common source of infections, serving up a cornucopia of germs. According to the FDA, in 1938, milkborne outbreaks accounted for <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/140394/download?attachment\">25 percent of all foodborne disease outbreaks</a>. In more recent times, milk has been linked to less than 1 percent of such outbreaks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that areas where raw milk was sold legally between 1998 and 2018 had <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/rawmilk/rawmilk-outbreaks.html\">3.2 times more outbreaks</a> than areas where the sale of raw milk was illegal.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/milk-guidance-documents-regulatory-information/questions-and-answers-regarding-milk-safety-during-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-hpai-outbreaks\">a Q&amp;A document</a>, the Food and Drug Administration notes that it does \"not know at this time if HPAI A (H5N1) viruses can be transmitted through consumption of unpasteurized (raw) milk and products (such as cheese) made from raw milk from infected cows.\" However, the agency goes on, because of that lack of data and the potential for infection, the FDA recommends halting all sales of raw milk and raw milk products from H5N1 infected or exposed cattle. In general, the agency recommends against consuming raw milk.</p>\n<p>Globally, as of March 28, there have been <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/wpro---documents/emergency/surveillance/avian-influenza/ai_20240503.pdf?sfvrsn=5f006f99_130\">888 cases of H5N1 reported</a> in humans in 23 countries. Of those 888 cases, 463 were fatal. That represents a 52 percent fatality rate; however, it's possible that there are asymptomatic or undiagnosed cases that could alter that rate. In the US, only one human so far is known to have been infected with H5N1 in connection with the dairy cow outbreak—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/we-still-dont-understand-how-one-human-apparently-got-bird-flu-from-a-cow/\">a farm worker who developed pink eye</a>. The man had no respiratory symptoms and recovered. He did not consent to further follow-up, and researchers did not get consent to test the man's household contacts to see if they, too, were infected.</p>\n\n                                                </div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/anti-pasteurization-crowd-reaffirms-love-of-raw-milk-despite-bird-flu-outbreak/\">Source link </a>"

From the halls of the Wyoming House to the halls of the U.S. House, her time in public service has always been focused on advocating for Wyoming’s future.</p><p>First elected to the U.S. House in 2008, Senator Lummis quickly earned her reputation as a no-nonsense conservative and principled policymaker. She was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group consisting of the most unflinching conservative Members of the House of Representatives. She fought throughout her tenure in Congress to rein in spending and reduce the federal deficit, working with the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and ultimately co-sponsoring several bipartisan budget proposals.</p><p>In the House of Representatives, Senator Lummis effectively elevated western issues, pushing through the first Interior and Environment (EPA) Appropriations bill to pass the House in seven years under her chairmanship. This marked a significant milestone for the Western Caucus and the rural communities across the West they represent. She also worked to keep public lands open to the public and available for multiple use. She successfully passed the National Forest System Trails Stewardship Act in 2016, a bipartisan effort led by Cynthia to maintain over 157,000 miles of trails within our national forests.</p><p>Senator Lummis is a dedicated champion of Wyoming’s mineral and energy resources. In Washington, she fought off attacks from the environmental left while advocating for market opportunities both at home and abroad. She is the proud godmother of the ANSAC Wyoming, a commercial shipping vessel transporting trona from the U.S. to Southeast Asia and is the recipient of the lifetime achievement award from the Washington Coal Club.</p><p>Prior to serving in the House of Representatives, Senator Lummis spent eight years as Wyoming State Treasurer and 14 years as a member of the Wyoming State House and Senate. She also worked as general counsel to Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer and Director of the Office of State Lands and Investments, as well as a law clerk at the Wyoming Supreme Court.</p><p>After departing U.S. House of Representatives in 2016, Senator Lummis operated her family’s cattle ranches, and the Sweetgrass development in Laramie County, with her brother and sister. She is a three-time graduate of the University of Wyoming in animal science, biology and law. She and her late-husband, Al Wiederspahn, have one daughter, Annaliese, son-in-law Will Cole and grandsons Gus and Al.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/cynthia-lummis/\">Source link </a>"

Prior to this, he served on the board of directors for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As of June 2023, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $1.6 billion.</p><h3><strong>Early Education and Career Start</strong></h3><p>Born and raised in New York City, Dimon pursued his early education at the Browning School. He later attended Tufts University where he majored in psychology and economics and graduated summa cum laude. An essay he wrote on Shearson’s mergers while at Tufts sparked his career in finance, leading Sandy Weill to hire him for a summer job at Shearson.</p><p>Post graduation, Dimon took up management consulting at Boston Consulting Group where he worked for two years. He then enrolled at Harvard Business School and spent the summer working at Goldman Sachs. In 1982, he graduated as a Baker Scholar with an MBA.</p><h3><strong>Career Progression and Achievements</strong></h3><p>Upon his graduation from Harvard, Dimon declined offers from prestigious firms including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Lehman Brothers to join American Express at the behest of Sandy Weill. Despite the lesser pay, Weill assured Dimon of an enriching experience. At the time, Dimon’s father, Theodore Dimon, was an executive vice president at American Express.</p><p>Dimon has the rare distinction of being one of the few bank CEOs who turned into a billionaire, largely thanks to his $485 million stake in JPMorgan Chase. His financial rewards fluctuated in the following years with a peak compensation of $23 million in 2011, a dip to $11.5 million in 2012 due to a series of controversial trading losses, and a surge to $34.5 million in fiscal year 2022.</p><p>Jamie Dimon’s influence in the finance world is widely recognized. He featured in Time magazine’s lists of the world’s 100 most influential people in 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2011. His tenacity, financial acumen, and leadership continue to shape the banking and finance industry.</p></div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/jamie-dimon/\">Source link </a>"

The researchers believe it affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the user's VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been discovered and used in the wild since then.</p>\n<h2>Reading, dropping, or modifying VPN traffic</h2>\n<p>The effect of TunnelVision is “the victim's traffic is now decloaked and being routed through the attacker directly,” a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU\">video demonstration</a> explained. “The attacker can read, drop or modify the leaked traffic and the victim maintains their connection to both the VPN and the Internet.”</p>\n<figure class=\"video\"><p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU[/embed]</p><figcaption class=\"caption\"><p>TunnelVision - CVE-2024-3661 - Decloaking Full and Split Tunnel VPNs - Leviathan Security Group.</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The attack works by manipulating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol\">DHCP server</a> that allocates IP addresses to devices trying to connect to the local network. A setting known as <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3442\">option 121</a> allows the DHCP server to override default routing rules that send VPN traffic through a local IP address that initiates the encrypted tunnel. By using option 121 to route VPN traffic through the DHCP server, the attack diverts the data to the DHCP server itself. Researchers from Leviathan Security explained:</p>                                            <aside class=\"ad_wrapper\" aria-label=\"In Content advertisement\">\n    <span class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </span>    \n        \n</aside>\n                                                        \n<blockquote><p>Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.</p>\n<p>We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a /0 CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple /1 routes to recreate the 0.0.0.0/0 all traffic rule set by most VPNs.</p>\n<p>Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.</p>\n<figure class=\"image shortcode-img center large\" style=\"width:100%\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TunnelVision_Diagram_DHCP_121_Reroute_Traffic.png\" class=\"enlarge\" data-height=\"1891\" data-width=\"1430\" alt=\"A malicious DHCP option 121 route that causes traffic to never be encrypted by the VPN process.\"><img alt=\"A malicious DHCP option 121 route that causes traffic to never be encrypted by the VPN process.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TunnelVision_Diagram_DHCP_121_Reroute_Traffic-640x846.png\" width=\"640\" height=\"846\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TunnelVision_Diagram_DHCP_121_Reroute_Traffic-1280x1693.png 2x\"/></a><figcaption class=\"caption\"><div class=\"caption-text\"><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TunnelVision_Diagram_DHCP_121_Reroute_Traffic.png\" class=\"enlarge-link\" data-height=\"1891\" data-width=\"1430\">Enlarge</a> <span class=\"sep\">/</span> A malicious DHCP option 121 route that causes traffic to never be encrypted by the VPN process.</div><p>Leviathan Security</p></figcaption></figure>\n<p>We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The attack can most effectively be carried out by a person who has administrative control over the network the target is connecting to. In that scenario, the attacker configures the DHCP server to use option 121. It’s also possible for people who can connect to the network as an unprivileged user to perform the attack by setting up their own rogue DHCP server.</p>                                            <aside class=\"ad_wrapper\" aria-label=\"In Content advertisement\">\n    <span class=\"ad_notice\">Advertisement </span>    \n        \n</aside>\n                                                        \n<p>The attack allows some or all traffic to be routed through the unencrypted tunnel. In either case, the VPN application will report that all data is being sent through the protected connection. Any traffic that’s diverted away from this tunnel will not be encrypted by the VPN and the Internet IP address viewable by the remote user will belong to the network the VPN user is connected to, rather than one designated by the VPN app.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Android is the only operating system that fully immunizes VPN apps from the attack because it doesn't implement option 121. For all other OSes, there are no complete fixes. When apps run on Linux there’s a setting that minimizes the effects, but even then TunnelVision can be used to exploit a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack\">side channel</a> that can be used to de-anonymize destination traffic and perform targeted denial-of-service attacks. Network firewalls can also be configured to deny inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface. This remedy is problematic for two reasons: (1) a VPN user connecting to an untrusted network has no ability to control the firewall and (2) it opens the same side channel present with the Linux mitigation.</p>\n<p>The most effective fixes are to run the VPN inside of a virtual machine whose network adapter isn’t in bridged mode or to connect the VPN to the Internet through the Wi-Fi network of a cellular device. The research, from Leviathan Security researchers Lizzie Moratti and Dani Cronce, is available <a href=\"https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision\">here</a>.</p>\n\n                                                </div>\n<br>[ad_2]\n<br><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/novel-attack-against-virtually-all-vpn-apps-neuters-their-entire-purpose/\">Source link </a>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Morgan Stanley Invests Over $269 Million in Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>\n\nMorgan Stanley, one of the top banking firms in the United States, recently disclosed in its Form 13-F filing that it has made a significant investment of more than $269 million in a spot Bitcoin ETF. This investment was made in Grayscale's GBTC during the first quarter of 2024.\n\n<h3>Growing Institutional Interest in Bitcoin ETFs</h3>\n\nThe investment by Morgan Stanley places it among the top holders of GBTC, following a substantial $1.0 billion investment by Susquehanna International Group. This move by Morgan Stanley reflects a trend among several Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) who have publicly disclosed their investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other banks joining this trend include Royal Bank of Canada, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and UBS.\n\nThese investments and allocations were highlighted during the first-quarter 13F reporting deadline, signaling the end of the initial period for investors to purchase most spot Bitcoin ETFs. Matt Hougan, the CIO of Bitwise, revealed that around 700 professional firms have invested nearly $5 billion in spot Bitcoin ETFs by the deadline of May 15.\n\nHougan described this trend as a historical scale of professional investor ownership, likening it to the successful launch of gold ETFs in 2004. Despite the influx of institutional capital, retail investments still play a significant role in the funds invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs, with total assets under management (AUM) reaching approximately $50 billion.\n\nOn May 14, Pine Ridge Advisers, a New York advisory firm, disclosed a $205.8 million investment in various spot Bitcoin ETFs. Additionally, alternative asset manager Aristeia Capital LLC, investment firm Graham Capital Management, hedge fund manager Crcm LP, Boothbay Fund Management, and Fortress Investment Group LLC have also revealed substantial investments ranging from $53.6 million to $377 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs.\n\nThe growing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs has attracted a diverse group of financial institutions and asset managers, signaling a significant shift towards embracing crypto assets in the traditional financial world.\n<br>"

SEBI's suggestion was made to a government panel with the task of formulating policies for the Finance Ministry to review. The panel is expected to submit its report by June.\n\n**Varied Perspectives**\n\nSEBI's stance contrasts with that of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which reportedly supports a ban on stablecoins, as per a source familiar with the panel's discussions. The RBI has consistently expressed concern about cryptocurrencies, labeling them as an existential threat to policy sovereignty.\n\n**Proposed Division of Responsibilities**\n\nSEBI proposed that monitoring cryptocurrencies resembling securities, as well as initial coin offerings (ICOs), falls under their domain. Moreover, the RBI could regulate assets backed by fiat currencies like stablecoins, while the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) could supervise insurance and pension-related virtual assets through collaboration with the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). \n\n**Resolution of Grievances**\n\nThe report further suggests that investor grievances in cryptocurrencies should be addressed under India's Consumer Protection Act.\n\n**Political Environment**\n\nIndia is currently in the midst of national elections, with results scheduled for June 4th. Jayant Sinha, chair of the parliament's Standing Committee on Finance, indicated in December that India is not likely to introduce specific legislation regarding crypto or Web3 before mid-2025.\n\n**Evolution of Crypto Policy**\n\nAlthough the Finance Ministry has been at the helm of India's crypto policy, maintaining ambiguity on the legality of cryptocurrencies while imposing heavy taxes, signs of change are emerging. Last year, the Finance Ministry led efforts as the G20 president to establish global consensus on crypto regulation. An official later stated that India would determine its stance on crypto in the forthcoming months. Notably, over 46 crypto-related firms have registered with India's financial intelligence unit, signaling a shift in credibility.\n\n**Silent Authorities**\n\nDespite these developments, SEBI, RBI, India's Finance Ministry, IRDAI, and PFRDA did not provide responses to inquiries from CoinDesk.\n\nIn conclusion, as India navigates through the intricate landscape of cryptocurrency regulation, the recommendations put forth by SEBI signify a step towards a more structured and diversified oversight approach.\n<br>"

This move not only showcases the increasing importance of collaboration between tech giants and decentralized platforms but also highlights the recognition of blockchain and cryptocurrencies by major companies.\n\n## Collaboration Benefits and Implications\n\nThe inclusion of Google Cloud as an SR candidate on Tron carries several implications. It demonstrates the maturity and stability of the Tron network, making it an attractive partner for renowned companies like Google Cloud. The collaboration could bring about technological advancements for Tron, leveraging Google Cloud's advanced computing capabilities. Moreover, it may inspire other large companies to explore blockchain technologies, further driving adoption and innovation in the sector.\n\n## Future Prospects and Synergies\n\nLooking ahead, the partnership between Tron and Google Cloud opens doors for innovation and synergies.

Additionally, the collaboration could catalyze research in the blockchain field, addressing technical challenges that the industry faces.\n\n## A Path Towards a Decentralized Future\n\nThe addition of Google Cloud as a super representative candidate on the Tron blockchain marks a significant milestone for both parties. It signifies the growing acceptance of blockchain technology and the potential of collaborations between tech giants and decentralized platforms. For the Tron community, this partnership signals a new era of growth, innovation, and a step closer to a more connected and decentralized future.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Ether-Bitcoin Ratio Hits Three-Year Low Amidst Underperformance\n\n## Declining Ratio Signals Bias Towards Bitcoin\nThe ratio between ether (ETH) and bitcoin (BTC) prices in dollars continues to plummet, extending year-to-date losses as indicated by the bearish death cross pattern observed a month ago. On the crypto exchange Binance, ETH/BTC dropped to 0.04563, hitting the lowest point since April 2021, showcasing a decline of almost 16% this year. This decline suggests a preference for bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value.\n\n## Factors Contributing to Ether's Underperformance\nThe slide to three-year lows follows diminished demand for ether-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs). Global ether ETPs witnessed net outflows of approximately $63.5 million last week, with Hong Kong-listed ETFs facing the most significant losses. In comparison, bitcoin ETPs saw an influx of $92.5 million during the same period.\n\n## Impact of Competing Layer 1s and Uncertainty on Ether\nMultiple factors, such as the rise of Ethereum competitors like Solana and uncertainty surrounding the approval of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S., are likely responsible for ether losing favor among investors. Coinbase Institutional's Research analyst David Han highlighted the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., solidifying bitcoin's store-of-value narrative. However, concerns persist regarding ETH’s fundamental position within the crypto sector, especially with the emergence of competing layer-1s like Solana.\n\n## Solana's Growing Market Share and SEC Approval Concerns\nSolana’s share in total decentralized exchange volumes has surged from 2% to 21%, eating into Ethereum's market dominance. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of spot BTC ETFs in January led to significant capital inflows of $12 billion. However, the approval of spot ETFs tied to ether could open new opportunities for Ethereum, although the SEC's decision timeline remains uncertain.\n\n## Regulatory Hurdles and Inflationary Shift\nThe SEC's cautious approach towards approving ETH ETF applications by firms like BlackRock poses challenges for ether’s mainstream adoption. Additionally, Ether recently turned inflationary, reversing the bullish deflationary trend seen since Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake ecosystem in 2022.\n\nAs the crypto market continues to evolve, the dynamics between ether and bitcoin remain fluid, influenced by regulatory developments, market competition, and investor sentiment.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Climate protesters clash with police at Tesla factory site near Berlin\n\n### Protesters attempt to break into Tesla factory\n\nHundreds of climate protesters clashed with police on Friday as they tried to break into Tesla's factory site near Berlin. The demonstration, which lasted for five days, was aimed at protesting against the carmaker's local expansion plans.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed crowds of black-clad protesters running towards Tesla premises. Reports from German media indicated that there were injuries among both police officers and protesters, as well as an unknown number of arrests.\n\n### Contradictory claims by Tesla CEO and police\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk denied that the protesters had reached Tesla property, questioning why they were not arrested for breaking and entering. He stated that the protesters did not manage to breach the fenceline, as there were still intact barriers around the property.\n\nPolice also refuted claims that protesters had entered the gigafactory, asserting that they only reached a field in front of the site. They mentioned that several individuals attempted to gain unauthorized access but were prevented from doing so.\n\n### Opposition to Tesla's expansion plans\n\nThe protest, organized by the group Disrupt Tesla, involved around 800 participants. Spokesperson Lucia Mende contradicted the statements made by both the police and Elon Musk, claiming that the demonstrators did reach Tesla property. She added that activists were en route to a disused airfield reportedly used by Tesla to store unsold cars.\n\nAnti-Tesla protester Mara, spokesperson for the group Stop Tesla, stated that protesters had broken through police lines to access the factory grounds in a show of unity against Tesla. Such acts of breaking into or occupying industrial sites have become common tactics within the climate movement across Europe.\n\n### Continued opposition from climate activists\n\nTesla's German factory, which manufactures electric cars and batteries, has been a target of protests from climate activists for months. Critics have accused the company of greenwashing and have opposed its plans for expansion in the nearby forest to increase production.\n\nThe expansion plans have faced opposition from a coalition of locals and climate activists, with over 60% of residents voting against the expansion in a nonbinding poll earlier this year. The protests are set to continue on Saturday, as tensions remain high between demonstrators, police, and the electric car manufacturer.\n<br>"

This surge also pushed its market capitalization close to the $10 billion milestone, indicating a potential revival in the market sentiment.</p>\n\n<h3>Analysts Predict Further Success for DOT</h3>\n\n<p>Experts in the field suggest that DOT could see a substantial rally in the coming days, potentially reaching levels between $20-$25 or $9-$13. This optimistic outlook is based on the cryptocurrency overcoming key resistance levels and benefiting from recent protocol developments.</p>\n\n<h2>Polkadot's Promising Future</h2>\n\n<p>One notable figure, Michael van de Poppe, believes that DOT has already hit its bottom and is now set for future gains. He pointed out that the introduction of the JAM whitepaper in April has positioned Polkadot for success in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>The JAM Gray Paper, released by the Polkadot team, integrates elements from both Polkadot and Ethereum, creating a global object environment. Another analyst, Block Diversity, also sees a bright future for DOT, with projections of the token's valuation surging to $13 once it clears the major resistance level of $6.90.</p>\n\n<h3>Insights from Other Analysts</h3>\n\n<p>Other crypto enthusiasts such as FLASH and Crypto Thanos have also weighed in on DOT's potential. FLASH described the recent price correction as a temporary setback, predicting a resurgence towards the $20 mark. Crypto Thanos suggested that DOT's price has already broken out of a descending parallel channel, hinting at further positive price movements.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the outlook for Polkadot appears promising, with multiple analysts and experts foreseeing continued success for the cryptocurrency. As the market continues to evolve, DOT's performance will be closely monitored to see if these predictions come to fruition.</p>\n<br>"

This move cements the investment bank as one of the major holders of GBTC, trailing only behind Susquehanna International Group’s substantial $1.0 billion investment.\n\n**Global Systemically Important Banks Join the Trend**\n\nMorgan Stanley is not the only Global Systemically Important Bank (G-SIB) to venture into the world of spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Royal Bank of Canada, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, and UBS have all disclosed their investments in this emerging asset class.\n\n**Other Firms Follow Suit**\n\nFollowing Morgan Stanley’s lead, other firms have also jumped on the Bitcoin ETF bandwagon. Pine Ridge Advisers, a New York advisory firm, disclosed a $205.8 million investment in spot Bitcoin ETFs, diversifying across BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s BITB.\n\nBoothbay Fund Management, a New York-based hedge fund manager, revealed a sizable exposure of $377 million to spot Bitcoin ETFs, spread out among various funds. Additionally, Aristeia Capital Llc, Graham Capital Management, Crcm Lp, and Fortress Investment Group LLC also disclosed their investments in Bitcoin ETFs.\n\n**The Growth of Bitcoin ETF Investments**\n\nThe recent filings coincide with the deadline for first-quarter 13F reports, marking the end of the first quarter where investors could purchase most spot Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan noted that approximately 700 professional firms were expected to have invested nearly $5 billion in Bitcoin ETFs by the May 15 deadline.\n\nHougan described this trend as a “historical scale of professional investor ownership,” drawing parallels to the successful launch of gold ETFs in 2004. Despite the influx of institutional money, retail investments continue to dominate the total assets under management (AUM) of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which currently stand at around $50 billion.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin Surges to $66,200</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin is priced at around $66,200, up about 6% in the last 24 hours, following its best day in two months. The surge came after U.S. inflation data raised the probability of an interest-rate cut by the Fed in coming months. BTC rose more than 7.5% on Wednesday, reflecting sensitivity to expected changes in monetary policy. Markets anticipate rate cuts by major central banks, including the Bank of England and European Central Bank in June. The broader digital asset market has also seen a rise of over 6% in the last 24 hours, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20).</p>\n\n<h2>CME to Launch Spot Bitcoin Trading</h2>\n<p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) plans to offer spot bitcoin trading in response to demand from clients, according to the Financial Times. As the top bitcoin futures exchange, CME aims to compete with major players like Binance and Coinbase in the spot market. The move could potentially attract institutional traders who prefer regulated platforms for trading. The spot trading business may be conducted through the EBC currency trading venue in Switzerland.</p>\n\n<h2>ShibaSwap Expands to Ethereum Layer 2</h2>\n<p>ShibaSwap, the decentralized exchange associated with meme coin Shiba Inu, has expanded to Ethereum layer 2 Shibarium. This expansion allows users to create new liquidity pools on Shibarium, enabling token swaps and earning trading fees for providing liquidity. The increased use of the Shibarium blockchain is expected to lead to a higher burn rate for the SHIB token, reducing its supply. The SHIB price has surged 8.8% in the past 24 hours, aligning with the broader market trend.</p>\n\n<h2>Record Dollar Value Locked in PEPE Futures Contracts</h2>\n<p>The chart of the day shows that the dollar value locked in open PEPE perpetual futures contracts on Binance hit a record $285 million on Wednesday. Each contract is sized at 1,000 PEPE. The data indicates a renewed interest in meme cryptocurrencies as weak U.S. data has boosted investor appetite for risky assets.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The cryptocurrency market continues to see significant movements, with Bitcoin surging to $66,200 and CME planning to introduce spot bitcoin trading. The expansion of ShibaSwap to Ethereum layer 2 is also driving excitement in the market. Additionally, the record dollar value locked in PEPE futures contracts underscores the growing interest in meme cryptocurrencies among investors.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># \"The Anxious Generation\" Tops Bestseller List\n\n## Social Media Impact on Youth\n\nThe book \"The Anxious Generation\" by NYU social psychologist Jonathan Haidt is currently dominating the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. It delves into the detrimental impact of social media on young people, particularly children, preteens, and teenagers. According to Haidt, popular apps like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have sparked a concerning epidemic of mental health issues among the youth, necessitating urgent action to reverse this alarming trend.\n\n## Academic Criticism and Dispute\n\nDespite receiving widespread support from concerned parents and sparking a movement for tighter regulations on social media platforms, Haidt's claims have not gone unchallenged. A review published in Nature, a prominent scientific journal, questioned the scientific basis of the book's premise. Candice L. Odgers, a professor of psychological science at UC Irvine, disputed Haidt's assertions, stating that there is currently no scientific evidence to support the assertion that social media is causing a mental health crisis among the younger generation.\n\n## Expert Opinion and Research\n\nOdgers, who has extensively researched adolescent mental health and social media use, pointed to various studies that failed to establish a direct link between social media usage and mental health issues. Despite acknowledging a rise in mental health concerns among young people, particularly girls, Odgers emphasized that attributing these issues solely to social media is unwarranted.\n\n## Legislative Measures and Industry Response\n\nThe debate surrounding the impact of social media on youth has significant implications for lawmakers and regulators considering restrictions on minors' access to these platforms. Proposed bills like The Kids Online Safety Act aim to address potential risks associated with social media use among children. However, concerns have been raised about the potential for excessive censorship and the emergence of unregulated alternatives to mainstream platforms.\n\n## Corporate Responsibility and Oversight\n\nCriticism has also been directed at tech giants like Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, for failing to adequately protect young users from harmful content. Revelations from internal emails revealed Meta executives' reluctance to allocate resources towards addressing child safety concerns, raising questions about their commitment to safeguarding vulnerable users.\n\nAs the debate rages on, the need for evidence-based policies and industry accountability becomes ever more pressing to ensure the well-being of today's digital-native youth.\n<br>"

However, 5th Scape is vying to become the decentralized counterpart to these giants, developing its own proprietary VR headsets and gaming chairs.</p>\n\n<h2>5th Scape provides exposure to two budding industries</h2>\n\n<p>With AI cryptocurrencies booming this year, it is common knowledge that projects with exposure to an emerging field can be highly lucrative. This is likely the reason for 5th Scape’s early buzz, with the project at the intersection of virtual reality and gaming.</p>\n\n<p>The project aims to unlock the limitless potential of the virtual realm by harnessing VR and AR technology to revolutionize gaming. From adrenaline-pumping battles to precision archery and immersive sports, 5th Scape aims to deliver hyper-realistic experiences.</p>\n\n<p>According to Grand View Research, the VR market is predicted to experience a 26.9% compound annual growth rate between 2023 and 2030. This growth extends beyond gaming and entertainment to include instructional training, an area highlighted in the 5th Scape whitepaper as another ecosystem pillar.</p>\n\n<h2>Analysts favor $5SCAPE for major gains after IEO</h2>\n\n<p>Top industry analysts and media outlets have noted 5th Scape’s potential and deemed it one of crypto’s most promising new projects. Key figures like Micheal Wrubel and Crypto Boy are bullish on the project and speculate significant gains post-IEO.</p>\n\n<p>Leading media outlets like Cointelegraph, Crypto Daily, and Techopedia have also rallied behind the new presale, acknowledging the potential of 5th Scape in the VR and gaming space.</p>\n\n<h2>Inherent utility and robust tokenomics hint that 5th Scape is more than just hype</h2>\n\n<p>Central to the 5th Scape ecosystem is the $5SCAPE token, which will be used to transfer value and reward holders with exclusive in-game advantages and early access. 80% of $5SCAPE tokens are earmarked for the presale, demonstrating the platform's commitment to community participation.</p>\n\n<p>The current 5th Scape price is $0.00327, with an expected incremental increase throughout the presale. Its exchange listing will begin at $0.01, representing a 205% increase from today's price.</p>\n\n<p>As the project continues to gain momentum and support from analysts and media outlets, 5th Scape's long-term success in the VR and gaming market looks promising.</p>\n<br>"

In 2024, he began discussing cryptocurrency in various interviews and even made investments in some cryptocurrency businesses.\n\n## Bitcoin ETFs Approval\n\nIn January 2024, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave approval for several bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This move allowed major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity to offer spot bitcoin ETFs to their clients. These ETFs quickly became the most successful launch in history, attracting billions in investments within months.\n\n## O'Leary's Stance\n\nWhile acknowledging the convenience of investing in bitcoin through an ETF, O'Leary personally does not see the value in this approach. He highlighted his reluctance to pay management fees associated with the ETFs, which can range from 0.24% to 1.5%. O'Leary believes that owning the cryptocurrency directly is a more cost-effective option.\n\n## Benefits of Direct Ownership\n\nBy owning bitcoin directly, individuals can circumvent the management fees charged by ETFs. The only fees incurred are those related to transaction costs, typically ranging from $1 to $2 on average. Additionally, direct ownership allows users to have full control over their tokens, enabling actions such as staking for interest or using them for payments.\n\n## O'Leary's Outlook\n\nDespite his reservations about bitcoin ETFs, O'Leary views their introduction as a positive development for the crypto community. He sees it as a signal that regulatory-compliant financial institutions are beginning to embrace cryptocurrency technology. O'Leary maintains a bullish stance on bitcoin, holding a 5% allocation in his investment portfolio.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile O'Leary acknowledges the benefits of bitcoin ETFs for some investors, he advocates for direct ownership of the cryptocurrency to avoid management fees. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the debate between ETFs and direct ownership remains a key consideration for investors seeking exposure to bitcoin.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announce new streaming bundle</h2>\n\n<h3>Streaming services join forces in a new partnership</h3>\nStreaming services are changing the way viewers consume content, with Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery announcing a new partnership to bundle Disney+, Hulu, and Max into one service. This move will combine a variety of popular platforms, including HBO, HGTV, ABC, FX, CNN, and iconic brands like Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and the DC Extended Universe. This bundling strategy marks a shift towards a more traditional cable TV model, consolidating multiple services into one package.\n\n<h3>Details of the new service and its launch</h3>\nThe new streaming service is set to launch in the summer, offering both ad-free and ad-supported tiers. However, specifics such as pricing and the possibility of it being a stand-alone app with its own name have yet to be announced. The potential color scheme of the app, if it is stand-alone, has already sparked curiosity and anticipation among consumers.\n\n<h3>Implications for the streaming industry</h3>\nThis new partnership not only complicates the landscape for entertainment guides and industry experts but also sets the stage for a showdown between streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and legacy media companies that have entered the streaming market. Disney's profitability in streaming and the success of Max have positioned these companies as tough competitors to beat, potentially causing concerns for other streaming services like Netflix.\n\n<h3>Impact on consumers</h3>\nA recent report by Parrot Analytics has highlighted that the Disney+/Hulu bundle, along with Max, are among the top three streaming services offering value for money based on demand for original content. The competitive pricing of the DisneyMax± bundle could pose a challenge to Netflix, especially with the release of highly anticipated series like \"The Acolyte\" and new seasons of popular shows.\n\n<h3>Uncertainties and future possibilities</h3>\nOne notable omission from the Disney-WBD announcement is the inclusion of live sports in the new streaming bundle. While a separate streaming sports bundle with Fox Corp. is in the works, the possibility of integrating sports content in the future cannot be ruled out as streaming services continue to evolve and consolidate. The upcoming launch of the Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery streaming bundle signals a new era in the streaming industry, with implications for both consumers and competitors alike.\n<br>"

With the 200-day moving average near the $2,800 support area, there is a possibility of a rally towards the $3,600 resistance zone in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNTYwIDEzMDkiIHdpZHRoPSIyNTYwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMDkiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZjcnlwdG9wb3RhdG8uY29tJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkYyMDI0JTJGMDUlMkZFVEhVU0RULURhaWx5LU1BeS0xNi0yMDI0LXNjYWxlZC5qcGci alt=\"eth_price_chart_1605241\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1309\"></p>\n\n<h3>4-Hour Chart Analysis:</h3>\n<p>The 4-hour chart provides a clearer picture, showing Ethereum’s price rising rapidly since yesterday but getting halted at the midline of the channel and the $3,000 resistance level.

Although there has been a decline in the metric over the last few months, a recent uptick suggests potential selling during price drops or reversals.

              "__cdata": "<br>## Senate Moves to Erase Controversial SEC Crypto Policy\n\n### Efforts to Overturn SAB 121\n\nThe U.S. Senate, following the House of Representatives, has taken a stance against the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) controversial crypto policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121. In a 60-38 vote, the Senate sought to erase SAB 121, commonly referred to as SAB 121. The initiative aimed to remove the policy raises concerns in the crypto industry regarding banking constraints. However, President Joe Biden has made it clear that he would veto the resolution, stating that it would disrupt ongoing efforts to protect investors in the crypto-asset markets and ensure the stability of the wider financial system.\n\nA dozen Democrats crossed party lines to support the resolution, joining a majority of Republicans to secure the necessary votes for passage. Despite the strong showing in the Senate, the resolution fell short of the votes needed to override a potential veto by the President.\n\n### Criticism of SAB 121\n\nIssued by the SEC in 2022, SAB 121 mandated that companies holding customers' cryptocurrencies must include them on their balance sheets. This requirement could have significant financial implications for banks that engage with crypto clients. Republican lawmakers and the Government Accountability Office criticized the SEC for implementing the policy without following the appropriate rule-making procedures, arguing that it should have been treated as a rule rather than staff guidance.\n\nLawmakers in both the House and Senate utilized the Congressional Review Act to challenge SAB 121, enabling them to overturn federal regulations. Despite warnings from the White House, a bipartisan effort emerged to combat the SEC's crypto policy, highlighting concerns about potential constraints on the regulator's ability to address future issues related to crypto-assets.\n\n### Historic Move by Congress\n\nThe move to overturn SAB 121 represents a significant development for the crypto industry, marking the first legislative action taken by Congress on a crypto-related issue. While previous attempts to introduce crypto taxation provisions faced industry resistance, the current effort is seen as a step towards supporting and regulating the sector. If successful, the reversal of SAB 121 would prevent the SEC from implementing similar policies in the future, shaping the regulatory landscape for crypto-assets.\n<br>"

This move comes as a surprise given the conservative nature of pension investments and the slow adoption of new financial instruments.\n\n## Institutional Investors Show Strong Interest in Bitcoin ETFs\n\nOver 500 institutional investors, including hedge funds and institutional advisers, have shown interest in spot bitcoin ETFs, marking a significant shift in the investment landscape. Experts note that such a high level of institutional interest is unusual for a newly launched ETF, with typically only about 200 investors involved at this stage.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT gains traction as the top choice for institutional investors, with hedge fund Millennium Management allocating a substantial portion of its assets to the fund. This trend signifies a growing acceptance of bitcoin as a legitimate investment option among professional investors.\n\n## Pension Funds Slowly Embrace Bitcoin ETFs\n\nPension funds, known for their risk-averse nature, are slowly warming up to the idea of including digital assets like bitcoin in their portfolios. While regulatory constraints and conservative investment strategies have historically deterred pension funds from venturing into this space, the recent move by the Wisconsin pension fund could signal a shift in the industry.\n\nETFs offer a convenient way for institutions to gain exposure to bitcoin without the complexities associated with direct ownership. With growing institutional interest and endorsements from major financial institutions like BlackRock, the path seems to be clearing for wider adoption of bitcoin ETFs in the investment community.\n\n## Vanguard Stands Firm Against Bitcoin Frenzy\n\nInvestment giant Vanguard remains cautious about jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon, citing concerns about the long-term viability of digital assets in retirement portfolios. Despite recent developments in the crypto space and speculation about potential policy changes, Vanguard's stance on bitcoin ETFs is not expected to shift anytime soon.\n\nAs institutional adoption of bitcoin gains momentum, the investment community anticipates a gradual but steady increase in allocations to digital assets. While some pension funds may take longer to embrace this new asset class, the overall trend towards greater acceptance of bitcoin ETFs among large investors appears to be gaining momentum.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Synchron and Paradromics Revolutionize Brain Implants\n\n## Inspiration from Medical Devices\n\nIn a groundbreaking move, Synchron and Paradromics have developed innovative brain implant devices, drawing inspiration from previous medical technologies. Paradromics' design, inspired by the Utah array, features wireless connectivity and 421 electrodes on tiny wires that are implanted in the brain tissue. These wires are significantly smaller than the shanks of the traditional Utah array, offering improved functionality.\n\nMeanwhile, Synchron's device is a hollow mesh tube resembling a heart stent. Unlike the conventional method of directly implanting into the brain, Synchron's device is inserted into the jugular vein at the base of the neck and pushed against the cortex. With ten successful implants, Synchron has witnessed impressive longevity, with one participant surpassing three years of device usage.\n\n## Concerns Raised by Experts\n\nAndrew Schwartz, a neurobiology professor at the University of Pittsburgh, has raised concerns about Neuralink's implant design potentially causing threads to push out of the brain. The necessity to open the outermost brain layer, known as the dura, for device placement presents challenges in suturing the dura closed after individual wire insertion into the cortex. This could lead to scar tissue formation, affecting the device's stability. In contrast, the Utah array facilitates suturing the dura closed post-implantation, ensuring better device retention.\n\n## Overcoming Setbacks\n\nDespite setbacks faced by Neuralink, including thread loss, the company successfully livestreamed a demonstration of its device. The modified recording algorithm, sensitive to neural signals, improved signal translation and enhanced user interface, enhancing device performance. This development has transformed the user experience significantly.\n\n## Enhancing Quality of Life\n\nFor individuals like Arbaugh, a user of Neuralink's device, the implant has revolutionized day-to-day activities. Pre-implant, Arbaugh used a mouth stick to operate a tablet, a cumbersome process that limited mobility. With Neuralink's device, he regained independence, reconnecting with the world and reducing dependency on caregivers.\n\n## Future of Brain-Computer Interfaces\n\nWhile setbacks are inevitable in the journey to commercialize brain-computer interfaces, companies like Synchron and Paradromics are paving the way for robust, reliable devices. As the field evolves, the focus remains on enhancing user experience and improving quality of life through cutting-edge technology.\n<br>"

Daily transactions on the network have soared to almost 18,000, marking a 193% jump compared to the previous day. However, this surge is still below the peak activity levels seen in mid-April when daily transactions were in the millions. Shibarium, launched in 2023, aims to enhance scalability, lower transaction fees, and improve speed, contributing to the development of the meme coin.</p>\n\n<h3>Price Rally Predicted</h3>\n<p>Analysts are predicting a potential 20-50% price increase for Shiba Inu due to several bullish factors. The burn rate of SHIB tokens increased by 4,000%, leading to the destruction of millions of tokens and potentially increasing scarcity and value over time. Analyst Ali Martinez believes that the asset's price could rise by 20% if it surpasses the upper boundary of a descending parallel channel. SHIB is currently above that level, sitting at $0.0000248. Dami-Defi is even more optimistic, suggesting a 50% price surge if SHIB breaks out of a falling wedge pattern on the 1D time frame.</p>\n\n<p>Shiba Inu has recently seen a 9% daily increase and an 18% monthly increase in value, indicating growing interest and potential for further gains. The positive trend in transaction activity and burn rate, coupled with optimistic price predictions, have investors and analysts keeping a close eye on the meme coin's performance in the market.</p>\n<br>"

The initiative aimed to expedite the tokenization of funds, with the findings detailed in a report released by DTCC on Thursday.\n\n<h3>Establishing a Standardized Process</h3>\nKnown as the Smart NAV project, the primary goal was to develop a standardized procedure for bringing and disseminating net asset value (NAV) data of funds across various private or public blockchains. This was made possible through the utilization of Chainlink's interoperability protocol CCIP. Noteworthy participants in this market initiative included American Century Investments, BNY Mellon, Edward Jones, Franklin Templeton, Invesco, JPMorgan, MFS Investment Management, Mid Atlantic Trust, State Street, and U.S. Bank.\n\n<h3>Key Findings from the Pilot</h3>\nUpon the completion of the pilot, DTCC observed that by transmitting structured data on-chain and establishing standardized roles and procedures, foundational data could be integrated into a range of on-chain applications. These include tokenized funds and 'bulk consumer' smart contracts, which are contracts holding data for multiple funds. The report highlighted the potential benefits and efficiencies derived from this approach.\n\nThe pilot project took place at a time when the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), such as bonds, funds, and traditional investments, has emerged as a significant use case for blockchain technology. Leading financial institutions like BlackRock, Citi, and HSBC have expressed interest in exploring the advantages of tokenization, including operational efficiencies, faster settlements, and enhanced transparency compared to conventional financial systems.\n\nOverall, the successful collaboration between DTCC, Chainlink, and major U.S. financial institutions underscores the growing momentum towards leveraging blockchain technology for asset tokenization and innovative financial solutions. This pilot project marks a significant step forward in the evolution of tokenized funds and blockchain integration within the financial industry.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>### Senate Votes to Overturn SEC's Crypto Policy\n\nThe U.S. Senate recently voted 60-38 to overturn a controversial Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto policy known as Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121, also known as SAB 121. This move comes after the House of Representatives passed a resolution seeking to erase the policy. Despite the bipartisan support for overturning SAB 121, President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the resolution, citing concerns about investor protection in the crypto-asset market and the broader financial system.\n\n#### Bipartisan Effort to Reverse SEC Policy\n\nA dozen Democrats joined a majority of Republicans in voting in favor of the resolution, providing it with well over the simple majority of votes needed to pass. However, the resolution did not receive enough votes to be veto-proof. Even Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opposed the SEC's crypto policy, aligning himself with other leaders in the Democratic Party who supported the resolution.\n\nRepublican Senator Cynthia Lummis, who spearheaded the effort in the Senate, criticized SAB 121 as a policy that failed to protect consumers. She expressed satisfaction with the Senate's decision, calling it a win for financial innovation and a clear rebuke of the Biden administration's treatment of crypto assets.\n\n#### Criticisms of the SEC's Crypto Policy\n\nIssued in 2022, SAB 121 required companies holding customer cryptocurrencies to record them on their balance sheets, potentially impacting banks working with crypto clients. Republican lawmakers argued that the SEC overstepped its authority by implementing the policy without going through the proper rule-making process. The Government Accountability Office also agreed that the SEC erred in handling the policy as staff guidance instead of a rule.\n\nIn response to the Senate vote, an SEC spokesperson defended SAB 121 as non-binding staff guidance aimed at enhancing investor disclosure regarding firms that safeguard crypto assets. The agency emphasized the importance of protecting consumers in the crypto industry, pointing to cases where customers of failed crypto firms had to seek legal recourse for their assets.\n\n#### Future Implications\n\nThis Senate vote marks a significant development in Congress's engagement with the crypto industry. By employing the Congressional Review Act to overturn SAB 121, lawmakers aim to prevent the SEC from implementing similar policies in the future. The bipartisan support for the resolution reflects broader concerns about regulatory transparency and investor protection in the evolving crypto landscape.\n\nLawmakers in the House and Senate urge President Biden to reconsider his intent to veto the resolution and instead sign it into law. The resolution's success would signal a shift in regulatory oversight of crypto assets and set the stage for a more collaborative approach to fostering innovation in the digital financial sector.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>The Rise and Impact of Black Twitter</h2>\n\n<h3>Fear and Uncertainty</h3>\n\nAs I embarked on a journey to chronicle Black Twitter in April 2021, I was plagued with fear and uncertainty. The fear of whether I should tell the story now, and the uncertainty of airing what many consider family secrets crept into the back of my mind. However, I was convinced that this story deserved to be told, despite the reasonable fear I, and many others, carried.\n\n<h3>Defining a Community</h3>\n\nBlack Twitter, as I discovered, is more than just a community. It is an ever-growing, always-evolving force that has had a profound impact on modern life. It is the birthplace of favorite memes, hashtags, and trends, shaping society and influencing nearly every aspect of our lives. From iconic hashtags like #OscarsSoWhite and #BlackLivesMatter to the historic presidency of Barack Obama, Black Twitter has been at the forefront of cultural conversations.\n\n<h3>The Endurance of Black Twitter</h3>\n\nDespite the emergence of other social media platforms like TikTok, Black Twitter remains the most dynamic subset of Twitter and the wider social internet. It continues to be a powerful force, showcasing news and analysis, serving as judge and jury, and providing a platform for community engagement and empowerment.\n\n<h3>The Importance of Preserving History</h3>\n\nIn a world where Black stories are frequently misrepresented and appropriated, it is crucial to preserve the rich history of Black Twitter before it is erased or co-opted. The impermanence of the social internet underscores the urgency of documenting and celebrating the impact of Black Twitter while it is still thriving.\n\n<h3>A Call to Action</h3>\n\nAfter the publication of the oral history of Black Twitter, efforts were made to document this cultural phenomenon through a documentary series. The goal is to give Black Twitter the recognition it deserves and to ensure that it is not relegated to a mere footnote in history.\n\nIn conclusion, the story of Black Twitter is a testament to the resilience and creativity of the Black community in digital spaces. It serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our stories and reclaiming our narrative in a world that often seeks to overlook or distort our contributions.\n<br>"

The platform noticed a substantial increase in the volume of stablecoins entering the market, indicating potential changes on the horizon.</p>\n<p>Notably, there have been noticeable spikes in stablecoin inflows at various points, often coinciding with movements in the price of bitcoin. This influx of stablecoins could have a profound impact on the supply and demand dynamics of the leading cryptocurrency, potentially leading to increased price volatility.</p>\n\n<h3>Enhanced Liquidity and Bitcoin’s Price Movement</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin experienced a surge in value earlier this year following the historic approval of US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain upward momentum since falling below its 2021 all-time high of $69,044 in April. The initial excitement surrounding ETFs has waned, slowing down Bitcoin's climb.</p>\n<p>Despite these challenges, recent data showing increased market liquidity, particularly through significant stablecoin inflows, suggests potential improvements on the horizon. This boost in liquidity could push Bitcoin towards a major bull run, providing hope for investors and traders alike.</p>\n\n<h3>Potential Bullish Momentum for Bitcoin</h3>\n<p>Recent market events, including contradicting US economic data and the likelihood of the Federal Reserve implementing rate cuts, have contributed to Bitcoin's recent price surge. The cryptocurrency witnessed its largest single-day increase in almost two months, jumping by nearly 8% to reach $66,400.</p>\n<p>Some market analysts predict that this bullish momentum could propel Bitcoin towards retesting its previous highs of around $74,000. Major institutional players, including asset managers like Millenium and Schonfeld, have shown confidence in the cryptocurrency by allocating a portion of their assets under management into the spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>\n<p>All these factors combined paint a positive picture for Bitcoin's potential breakout and a return to new all-time highs in the near future.</p>\n<br>"

These startups will explore new ways to use money to address real-world challenges, enhance user experiences, and broaden the utility of blockchain technology.</p>\n\n<h3>Mastercard Emphasizes Global Payments Expertise</h3>\n\n<p>Mastercard highlighted its expertise in constructing a global payments network, showcasing its capability to connect regulated money, bank deposits, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) with startups. The program’s objective is to drive the development of new solutions that improve digital commerce user experiences.</p>\n\n<p>The Start Path program will leverage blockchain technology's unique capabilities by collaborating with industry experts and fintech startups to identify and develop use cases that address pressing societal needs. Selected startups will gain access to special training, mentorship, and Mastercard’s network of customers and channels over four months.</p>\n\n<p>Among the selected startups are Kulipa, a French-based company facilitating crypto payment card issuance, UK-based Parfin focusing on enterprise-grade software products for financial institutions, Singapore’s Peaq providing permissionless digital infrastructure, U.S.-based Triangle integrating climate data with finance, and Belgium-based Venly simplifying blockchain integration.</p>\n\n<h3>Mastercard’s Successful Live Test of Multi-Token Network</h3>\n\n<p>In a recent announcement, Mastercard and Standard Chartered Bank Hong Kong (SCBHK) completed the first live test of Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN). The proof-of-concept pilot involved tokenizing carbon credits within the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) Fintech Supervisory Sandbox, showcasing a novel blockchain application in financial services.</p>\n\n<p>During the pilot, a client of SCBHK’s virtual bank, Mox Bank, deposited funds into Mox and requested a carbon credit. Subsequently, Mox directed SCBHK to tokenize the carbon credit through Libeara, a tokenization service provider developed by SC Ventures. The MTN tokenized the deposit, and an atomic swap was executed to swap the tokens.</p>\n\n<p>Mastercard launched the MTN in June 2023 using its private blockchain infrastructure, with previous trials including collaborations with the Reserve Bank of Australia and the HKMA’s e-HKD CBDC. These trials demonstrated the potential for modernizing financial transactions with technologies like CBDCs.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Donald Trump's Cryptocurrency Involvement Makes Headlines\n\n## Trump's Support for Cryptocurrency\n\nIn early May, former President Donald Trump hosted an NFT event where he dined with supporters of one of his NFT projects. During the dinner, Trump expressed his support for cryptocurrency and emphasized his desire to create a regulatory-friendly environment for cryptocurrency companies in the U.S.\n\n## Trump's Earnings from Cryptocurrency\n\nTrump's foray into cryptocurrency began in late 2022 after the release of the Trump Digital Trading Cards NFTs collection. The project, which featured 45,000 NFTs priced at $99 each, generated over 1,800 ETH in royalties for Trump. In late 2023, Trump sold 1,075 ETH for $2.4 million, retaining ownership of over 800 ETH valued at $2.4 million.\n\n## Trump's Donations and Holdings\n\nAlthough Trump's ETH earnings were not considered donations, he received over $5 million in donations from various cryptocurrency companies. Additionally, in August 2023, Trump received 580,000 Maga Coin (TRUMP) tokens as a marketing gesture. When the token's value peaked at $11.56 in March 2024, Trump's tokens were worth over $6.7 million.\n\n## Impact of Trump's Statements on Cryptocurrency Prices\n\nTrump's recent comments at the NFT event, where he encouraged support for cryptocurrency, led to a surge in MAGA Coin prices. Despite a subsequent price drop, the token remains above $5, with Trump's holdings amounting to over $5 million. Whether Trump will sell his holdings remains uncertain, but their value is significant, especially considering the substantial funds raised for his election bid.\n\n## Future Prospects in Cryptocurrency\n\nWith Trump's substantial earnings and holdings in cryptocurrency, his involvement in the market continues to attract attention. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, Trump's position and statements are likely to influence market trends and investor sentiment.\n\nIn conclusion, Donald Trump's recent foray into cryptocurrency has generated significant earnings and donations, underscoring the growing intersection between politics and digital assets. His vocal support for cryptocurrency and favorable regulatory stance indicate a potential shift in how policymakers engage with this emerging financial sector. As Trump's cryptocurrency holdings gain value and attention, the implications for both the political and financial landscape remain to be seen.\n<br>"

The vote has sparked cautious optimism among Bitcoin enthusiasts and lawmakers, who are now waiting to see if the resolution will be vetoed by the presidential office.</p>\n\n<h3>Overturning SAB 121</h3>\n<p>The resolution, known as H.J.Res.109, signifies congressional disapproval of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121) issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) two years ago. This bulletin provided accounting guidance for publicly traded banks interested in offering services to safeguard their customers’ cryptocurrency assets.</p>\n\n<p>Many critics of SAB 121 argue that it poses as a guidance but acts as a rule, making it financially burdensome and practically impossible to provide such services. Lawmakers, including House Rep Tom Emmer (R-Minn), have condemned SEC chair Gensler’s attempt to expand the commission's authority through this bulletin.</p>\n\n<h3>A Divided Vote</h3>\n<p>The resolution previously passed through the House of Representatives with 55% of votes in favor. The Senate vote on Thursday showed a more distinct split of 60/38, with all Republicans and 11 Democrats supporting the resolution.</p>\n\n<h2>Challenges Ahead with President Biden</h2>\n<p>Despite the positive outcome in Congress, neither the House nor the Senate achieved a strong enough majority to override a potential veto from President Joe Biden. Biden has already made it clear that he intends to veto the resolution if it reaches his desk.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is hope that the Senate's decision could influence the administration's stance on crypto custody services. Influential senators, like Chuck Schumer, defied party lines in the vote, signaling a potential shift in perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, highlighted the impact of the vote on regulatory agencies and their enforcement actions towards cryptocurrencies. This resolution marks a significant milestone as the first crypto-focused legislation to pass through both chambers of Congress.</p>\n<br>"

The order specifically mentioned that MineOne is majority-owned by Chinese nationals and required all mining equipment within a mile of the military facility in Cheyenne to be removed.\n\n<h3>Surprising Timing of the Order</h3>\nThe timing of the order raised eyebrows as MineOne had sold the sites to CleanSpark less than a week before the presidential directive. CleanSpark had announced the acquisition of two mining sites for nearly $19 million in cash, with plans to expand the sites by an additional 55 megawatts.\n\nWhile CleanSpark claimed ignorance of the order prior to purchasing the sites, the company acknowledged the concerns raised and expressed its intention to proceed with the deal to ensure national security and promote economic development in Wyoming.\n\n<h2>Due Diligence and Concerns</h2>\nThe details of the $19 million deal were fully disclosed in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by CleanSpark. The purchase was contingent on securing massive amounts of energy to power the mining operations.\n\nThe sale agreement with MineOne was signed by Jiaming Li, the company's director with ties to China. Li, a prominent figure in the Chinese business community, has managed significant assets and has a background in economics. The involvement of a Chinese-owned company so close to a critical military facility raised serious national security concerns.\n\n<h3>CFIUS Intervention</h3>\nThe use of Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) powers to block the acquisition by individuals linked to China marked a significant development. This was the eighth use of CFIUS powers, with most involving China. Legal experts highlighted this as the first presidential prohibition utilizing expanded authority over real estate transactions granted under the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018.\n\nIn light of the national security implications and the sensitive nature of the mining operations near a U.S. military facility, the CleanSpark deal faces scrutiny and potential challenges moving forward.\n<br>"

The knobs on the device seemed confusing, and instead of searching for a product manual online, he turned to Anthropic's Claude chatbot for help. By snapping a photo of the knobs and using the app, he was able to receive more context about their functions.</p>\n\n<h2>Anthropic's iOS App Claude Unveiled for Public Use</h2>\n\n<p>Anthropic recently released the iOS app for Claude, which proved to be a valuable tool for Lewenstein. Eager to explore various chatbots, the author of the Wired article decided to give Claude a try. In a video chat with Lewenstein, he learned valuable tips on how to effectively communicate with the chatbot and extract useful information.</p>\n\n<h2>Effective Communication with Chatbots</h2>\n\n<p>Lewenstein emphasized the importance of engaging in a conversation with chatbots like Claude, rather than resorting to short, blunt queries like one would on Google Search. He advised users to be more verbose and detailed in their prompts to elicit the most useful responses.</p>\n\n<h2>Utilizing AI Image Analysis and Direct Communication</h2>\n\n<p>Lewenstein recommended using images as conversation starters with Claude, as AI image analysis can offer a quick way to interact with the chatbot. Additionally, being overly prescriptive in prompts and providing clear direction on the desired format and tone of responses can lead to better outcomes.</p>\n\n<h2>Troubleshooting and Document Analysis</h2>\n\n<p>If initial queries do not yield desirable results, Lewenstein suggested providing feedback to the chatbot within the same chat window instead of starting a new conversation thread. Claude's ability to analyze uploaded documents can be particularly useful, especially in workplace scenarios. By uploading data, users can uncover trends and key information within large text documents.</p>\n\n<h2>Conversing Like Friends and Continuous Improvement</h2>\n\n<p>Approaching conversations with chatbots as a natural back-and-forth dialogue can enhance the user experience. Lewenstein highlighted the friendly and engaging outputs generated by Claude, emphasizing the importance of remaining open to exploring new AI tools as they rapidly evolve and improve.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Unveils New Roadmap for DeAI and Chain Fusion\n\n## ICP Marks Third Anniversary with Year 4 Internet Computer Roadmap\n\nIn an official statement released to CryptoPotato, the decentralized blockchain network Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) has revealed its new roadmap for driving decentralized artificial intelligence (DeAI) and chain fusion in the web3 space. The announcement comes as ICP celebrates the third anniversary of its mainnet launch.\n\n### Focus on DeAI and Chain Fusion\n\nThe latest roadmap from ICP summarizes three years of progress on its mainnet and highlights key development areas aimed at establishing the network as the hub of DeAI and the orchestration layer for the blockchain industry. Among the various focal areas outlined in the roadmap, the key highlights include DeAI and chain fusion.\n\nThe DeAI roadmap envisions a future where AI models are trained to run on-chain, offering transparency and visibility into how data is being utilized. ICP's AI smart contracts are set to enhance inference engines, leading to improved consistency, reliability, and responsiveness of AI.\n\nAccording to Dominic Williams, chief scientist and founder of Dfinity Foundation, the organization behind ICP, the Internet Computer aims to become the leading Third-Generation public blockchain, driving a 'blockchain singularity' where decentralized blockchains become the predominant tech stack, hosting secure AI applications.\n\n### Addressing Liquidity Fragmentation\n\nMoreover, ICP's chain fusion roadmap seeks to enable direct interoperability with major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ethereum Virtual Machines, eliminating the need for intermediaries. This interoperability will address liquidity fragmentation and combat tribalism within the blockchain space, empowering developers to create contracts spanning multiple chains seamlessly.\n\nWilliams emphasized the commitment of DFINITY Foundation to enhance the network's speed, efficiency, and power through a new roadmap. Notably, ICP has maintained uptime since its mainnet launch in May 2021, processing over three billion blocks and securing more than $3 billion in total locked value.\n\nAs ICP continues to advance its roadmap for DeAI and chain fusion, the network's role in shaping the future of decentralized technology and innovation remains pivotal in the evolving web3 landscape.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>### Exploring the World of Zero-Knowledge Proofs: A Cloak of Privacy Online\n\n**Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) explained**\n\nIn the realm of cryptography, a revolutionary concept known as zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) has been making waves. ZKPs allow one party, known as the prover, to demonstrate to another party, the verifier, that they possess specific knowledge without disclosing that knowledge. Simply put, ZKPs enable the verification of information without revealing its actual content. \n\nOne intriguing analogy that illustrates the power of zero-knowledge proofs is the \"Ali Baba cave\" scenario: imagine a prover, Peggy, wanting to prove to a verifier, Victor, that she knows the secret passphrase to enter a cave without actually disclosing the passphrase itself. Peggy takes Victor to the cave entrance, enters, and then exits through a different route. She challenges Victor to determine the original entrance she used. If Victor succeeds, Peggy will reveal the passphrase. However, if Victor fails, Peggy has successfully proven her knowledge of the passphrase without revealing it.\n\n**How do zero-knowledge proofs work?**\n\nAchieving zero-knowledge proofs involves a complex series of interactions using mathematical algorithms and protocols that facilitate communication between the prover and verifier. One common type of ZKP is the interactive protocol, where the prover and verifier engage in a series of steps to establish the validity of the statement without disclosing specific information.\n\n**Types of zero-knowledge proofs**\n\nZero-knowledge proofs come in various types, including interactive and non-interactive ZKPs, such as zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, each tailored to serve specific purposes and offer unique advantages in different applications. Interactive ZKPs require interaction between the prover and verifier, while non-interactive ZKPs eliminate the need for direct engagement.\n\nThese ZKPs find applications in fields like blockchain technology, identity verification, digital voting, data sharing, authentication, and privacy-preserving technologies. ZKPs enhance privacy, security, and efficiency in digital interactions by allowing secure validation of information without revealing sensitive details.\n\n**Advantages and challenges of zero-knowledge proofs**\n\nZero-knowledge proofs offer advantages such as privacy, security, and efficiency in digital transactions. They enable parties to prove knowledge of something without disclosing the actual information, enhancing data confidentiality. However, challenges like computational intensity and complexity exist, requiring careful implementation and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, zero-knowledge proofs play a pivotal role in ensuring privacy and security online, laying the foundation for secure digital interactions in an increasingly interconnected world.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Coinbase Shares Drop on CME Bitcoin Trading Rumors\n\n### Coinbase Shares Plunge Amid Reports of CME Offering Spot Bitcoin Trading\n\nShares of Coinbase took a hit on Thursday, sliding nearly 8% to a price of $202.49 during U.S. morning hours. The drop was attributed to a report from the Financial Times indicating that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) was potentially considering offering spot bitcoin trading to its clients.\n\n### Cryptocurrency Market Reacts\n\nDespite the decline in Coinbase shares, the overall cryptocurrency market saw gains on the day. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the largest digital tokens by market capitalization, was up by 0.91% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin itself experienced a modest increase of half a percent, benefiting from a recent better-than-expected inflation report.\n\n### CME's Potential Impact on Coinbase\n\nChicago-based CME, known as the largest futures exchange globally, has a long-standing history and is considered a financial powerhouse. The possible entry of CME into the spot bitcoin trading market could pose a significant threat to Coinbase, which has historically been the most trusted crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\n### Regulatory Significance of CME\n\nCME holds a designation by U.S. regulators as a \"systemically important financial market utility,\" indicating that it is subject to more stringent supervision. This designation implies that the government would likely intervene to prevent the exchange from failing in times of financial distress.\n\n### Expansion of Bitcoin Trading\n\nCME is currently the largest bitcoin futures exchange in the U.S. and has been engaging with traders interested in regulated bitcoin trading. The move to offer spot bitcoin trading aligns with a growing trend of traders seeking safer ways to invest in digital assets, particularly in light of past issues with certain crypto exchanges.\n\n### Rise of Bitcoin ETFs\n\nThe recent introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has provided traders with a more secure avenue for investing in the token. Within the first three months of their existence, these ETFs attracted over 500 institutions, resulting in over $10 billion in allocations, with an additional $40 billion coming from retail traders.\n\nOverall, the potential shift in the market dynamics with CME entering the spot bitcoin trading arena has created ripples across the cryptocurrency industry, impacting players like Coinbase and paving the way for new avenues of investment in digital assets.\n<br>"

I think not. Now is an excellent time to stock up on books for the summer, because Amazon has a huge book sale running through May 20. Ebook prices start at $1, while print books are going for as low as $5. Every genre you can think of is covered in the sale, from classics to children's books to BookTok faves. \n\n<h3>Get Your Summer Reading Ready</h3>\nWe've seen this deal before, but it still matches the best price we've tracked. The Kindle Scribe (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is expensive. This deal makes it a bit more accessible. It's the Best Kindle for note-taking and annotation. It's also the only Kindle that's on sale right now.Usually Kindle Unlimited trials are a month long, but right now new subscribers can try the service out for two months longer. Keep in mind that the service will automatically renew at $12 per month once the trial is up, so set a reminder to cancel if you don't want those subsequent charges. Kindle Unlimited is one of our favorite ebook subscription services. It helped me get back into reading as an adult.\n\n<h3>Book Recommendations</h3>\nNeal Stephenson named the Metaverse. How much more WIRED can you get? This classic cyberpunk tale is worth every penny.\n\nPeople have a lot of strong opinions about this author, but if you're curious, you can save on one of her most popular titles. This tender romance novel is being made into a movie that'll be released in August.\n\nThis novel is arguably the perfect beach read. It's romantic and glamorous, with a well-rounded cast of characters and the right level of intrigue to keep you turning the pages.\n\nI devoured this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. If the thought of a badass heroine, talking dragons, a bully romance trope, and a quest to save the world gets your blood pumping, this one lives up to the hype.\n\nBooks are almost always better than their movie adaptations. No shade to the wonderful Kathy Bates, but Misery is definitely one of those cases. I probably shouldn't have read it when I was 13, but I did, and I still think about it. I think it's one of King's best works. If you've already read it, Fairy Tale—a newer King novel—is also on sale for $13 ($8 off).\n\nThis memoir comes highly recommended by WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano. She said it “shattered her heart into a million pieces.” I'll be buying a copy based on that recommendation alone, but if you need more convincing, just check out the thousands of 5-star reviews on Amazon.\n\nThis memoir has been a New York Times bestseller for 80 weeks and counting. It explores McCurdy's life as a child actor, complete with an overbearing mother, addiction, eating disorders, and more—but it ends on a good note, with themes of resilience and self-discovery. (I'll be buying this one too).\n\nIt's a Dr. Seuss board book and it's $3 and I guarantee the kids in your life will get a kick out of it (pun very much intended). They can lift the flaps and discover opposites. You can read the rhymes. It's a win-win situation.\n\nI, for one, am fully here for Snoop Dogg's culinary career. This cookbook was made in collaboration with E-40, who should need no further introduction. It contains more than 60 recipes that share a common theme—getting together with your loved ones and eating good food.\n\nReviewer Scott Gilberton jokingly called this “light reading,” but despite its heaviness, it's still worth reading. This novel sits with you long after you put it down. It's gritty, it's poignant, and despite its heady narrative, it isn't too difficult to read. Most of all, though, it'll stick with you—I recommend having a highlighter handy.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Ether Continues to Fall Behind Bitcoin After Merge Upgrade</h2>\n\n<p>More than 19 months after Ethereum’s historic Merge upgrade, the data is clear: the network’s native asset, Ether (ETH), is not keeping up with Bitcoin (BTC). The ETH/BTC price ratio tapped another three-year low on Thursday at 0.044, with Ether last experiencing less market dominance against Bitcoin in May of 2021.</p>\n\n<h3>Why Does ETH Keep Dumping Against BTC?</h3>\n\n<p>The trend has been offputting and confusing for Ethereum bulls, of whom many assumed ETH would become a more appetizing investment than Bitcoin following the September 2022 Merge. At the time, the upgrade introduced a proof of stake consensus mechanism, and lowered ETH’s inflation rate by 90%. Combined with Ethereum’s previously implemented transaction fee-burning mechanics, this meant ETH was now both an investment with intrinsic yield and a negative inflation rate – bullish properties that its older brother BTC did not possess.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these qualities, ETH/BTC has fallen 45% since the Merge took place. This is especially noteworthy given that crypto has been in a general bull market for the past 18 months. During such times, altcoins are accustomed to outperforming BTC.</p>\n\n<p>Joe McCann, the founder of crypto fund Asymmetric, tweeted on Wednesday that “the flippening” – a dream that the market cap of ETH might one day surpass that of BTC – “was always a dream that has turned into a nightmare.” He argued that “Bitcoin is ‘ultrasound money’ and Solana is the “global supercomputer,” while Ethereum is neither.</p>\n\n<p>Experts at CryptoQuant argued that Ether is no longer “ultrasound money” since its Dencun upgrade took effect in March 2024. While lowering transaction fees for users, it also turned Ether into an inflationary currency again, hurting its investment thesis as a better store of value than Bitcoin.</p>\n\n<p>Recent technical breakthroughs have allowed developers to bring applications to Bitcoin that were once unique to Ethereum and other more programmable chains. These include Ordinals NFTs, Runes trading, and BitVM – a new framework for bringing smart contracts and trust-minimized layer 2 networks to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin has already become a more popular chain for NFT trading than Ethereum.</p>\n\n<h3>Ethereum’s Regulatory Woes</h3>\n\n<p>Aside from technical concerns, Ethereum also faces major headwinds on the regulatory front. While Bitcoin spot ETF products were approved in January, experts believe any imminent approval for an Ether spot ETF remains highly unlikely. Most altcoins, including Ether, appear to be on the radar of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, prompting legal trouble against exchanges and other companies interacting with such assets.</p>\n\n<p>Solana (SOL) is up 665% over the past year, compared to ETH’s 61% rise. Ether’s total crypto market dominance is now down to 15.1%, versus Bitcoin’s 54.5%, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>\n<br>"

The nation’s National Bitcoin Office initiated its blockchain-based capital raise on the Liquid network, marking a significant step in the country’s adoption of cryptocurrency.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin-Based Capital Markets Launched</h3>\n\n<p>The launch of Bitcoin-based capital markets in El Salvador, the first country to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender, was a historic milestone. The Liquid network, a Bitcoin sidechain managed by Blockstream and a federation of 65 Bitcoin-centric companies worldwide, provides a platform for faster, cheaper, and more private transactions compared to the main Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>Using BTC as its native asset, Liquid enables the issuance of tokens representing a variety of assets, including stablecoins like Tether (USDT), meme coins, and real-world assets and securities.</p>\n\n<h3>Investing in Development with Tokenized Offerings</h3>\n\n<p>El Salvador’s token offerings include opportunities to invest in the construction of the first hotel at El Salvador International Airport. Investors can expect a 10% annual return over a five-year period, with a minimum investment of $1000.</p>\n\n<p>The hotel infrastructure will feature 80 rooms, commercial spaces, a swimming pool, restaurants, a gym, gardens, and other amenities, as stated on the Inverlag Hotels website.</p>\n\n<p>Investors who contribute $1 million will receive complimentary stays at the hotel throughout the five-year bond tenure, showcasing the unique benefits of these tokenized investments.</p>\n\n<h3>The Role of DitoBanx and Bitfinex</h3>\n\n<p>The tokenized offerings in El Salvador were facilitated by the Bitcoin startup DitoBanx and the exchange platform Bitfinex. However, due to regulatory restrictions, U.S. investors are unable to participate in these investment opportunities.</p>\n\n<h2>El Salvador’s Progressive Approach to Bitcoin</h2>\n\n<p>As the first and only country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar, El Salvador continues to demonstrate its commitment to cryptocurrency adoption. Not only does the state invest in BTC, but it also operates a Bitcoin mining venture powered by geothermal energy from local volcanoes.</p>\n\n<p>With a total of 474 BTC mined since 2021 and holdings of 5,750 BTC (equivalent to $378 million), El Salvador’s embrace of Bitcoin extends beyond currency integration to encompass innovative tokenized investment offerings that pave the way for future financial opportunities.</p>\n<br>"

Other prominent investors include Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Elliott Investment Management. Additionally, firms from diverse geographies like State of Wisconsin Investment Board, Bank of Montreal, and others from Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, and Switzerland have also made investments in the ETFs.\n\n### Snapshot into Investor Holdings\n\nFollowing the deadline to file first-quarter 13F reports with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, it was discovered that roughly 1,000 filers held shares in the Bitcoin ETFs. Market makers like Citadel Securities and quant-trading firm Susquehanna International Group were also among the investors.\n\n### Purpose of Investments\n\nThe reports only provide a snapshot in time, and it remains unclear why money managers were holding the ETFs. While some investors might be bullish on Bitcoin, others may have opened positions to capitalize on the cryptocurrency’s volatility or hedge their short positions in derivatives. The investments may also be part of basis trades or model-driven strategies, rather than indicative of beliefs in Bitcoin's fundamental value.\n\n### Continued Expansion of Bitcoin ETF Interest\n\nDespite the varied reasons for investment, the trend indicates that Wall Street is increasingly venturing into the world of digital assets through Bitcoin ETFs. Professional investors are taking small personal allocations before committing on behalf of their clients as they test the waters of this market.\n\nThe demand for Bitcoin ETFs has seen record inflows, with market participants closely monitoring the money flow into these funds as they continue to break records. The reasons behind these purchases may vary, but the interest in Bitcoin ETFs is undeniably clear. Whether viewed as a diversifier or a hedge against inflation, Bitcoin continues to attract a wide range of investors looking to capitalize on the digital asset's potential.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Google's AI Overviews: A New Feature in Search Results\n\n## What Triggers AI-generated Summaries?\n\nGoogle's AI Overviews appear in search results for complex queries, according to Mallory De Leon, a Google spokesperson. The AI Overviews are designed to provide quick information from a range of sources, making them especially helpful for users. During initial tests, the AI Overviews seemed to appear randomly for both simple and more complicated questions.\n\n## The Power Behind AI Overviews\n\nDe Leon explains that the AI Overview feature is powered by Google's customized Gemini model, supplemented with elements from the company's Search system, such as the Knowledge Graph, containing billions of general facts.\n\nFor some AI Overview answers, the webpage links are immediately visible, while for others, users need to click \"Show more\" to see the information sources.\n\n## Concerns About Accuracy\n\nOne concern about the AI Overview feature is the potential for AI hallucinations or inaccuracies. While Google's Gemini chatbot comes with a disclaimer warning about potentially inaccurate information, the AI Overviews simply state that generative AI is experimental. This lack of a disclaimer about potential inaccuracies in AI Overviews raises concerns about the reliability of the information presented.\n\nWhen questioned about the absence of a disclaimer for AI Overviews, De Leon emphasizes that Google conducted adversarial red-teaming tests to ensure the feature's quality and safety systems. She assures that the AI Overviews are designed to highlight easily verifiable information.\n\n## The Future of AI Overviews\n\nGoogle's head of Search, Liz Reid, mentioned that AI Overviews are expected to roll out in countries outside the United States by the end of 2024, impacting over a billion users. This new feature has raised apprehensions among publishers and users alike, as it may lead to less trustworthy results and affect traditional search habits.\n\nDespite the potential time-saving benefits of AI Overviews, users are encouraged to verify information by clicking through the provided webpage links. The introduction of AI-generated summaries in search results signifies a significant shift in how users interact with information online, raising questions about the reliability and implications of such technology.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Cardano Whales Increase ADA Holdings</h2>\n<p>Cardano, like the rest of the cryptocurrency market, experienced a lackluster month recently. However, a specific group of high-profile investors has been quietly accumulating significant amounts of ADA tokens. These \"whales,\" who hold between 100 million and 1 billion ADA, have increased their balances by 11% in the past month, according to ITB's latest findings.</p>\n\n<p>This surge indicates a growing confidence or strategic positioning among large ADA holders. Currently, this group of ADA investors holds 6.71% of the entire token supply, showcasing their substantial influence within the Cardano ecosystem.</p>\n\n<h3>Market Activity and Price Analysis</h3>\n<p>There has been a gradual increase in Cardano whale activity over recent weeks. Typically, such spikes in whale activity precede potential price reversals, indicating shifts in market sentiment. Surprisingly, ADA has closely followed the broader market movement, showing a modest recovery with a nearly 6% surge in the past 24 hours, reaching $0.456 at the time of writing.</p>\n\n<p>Experts foresee a bullish outlook for ADA, with predictions suggesting a potential surge to $7.80 and even reaching a \"parabolic\" peak of $10. Additionally, speculation about Gemini listing ADA has fueled optimism for a significant price rally if the US-based exchange decides to support the token.</p>\n\n<h2>Cardano's User Activity Declines</h2>\n<p>Despite positive price projections, user activity on the Cardano network has been dwindling since March this year. Data from Artemis reveals that daily transactions on the network have significantly decreased to around 50.7k compared to nearly 96k recorded two months ago. Similarly, daily active addresses have also dropped below 24k this month, raising concerns about the network's current adoption rates and usage.</p>\n\n<p>These declines in user activity contrast with the optimistic sentiment surrounding Cardano's price potential, indicating a divergence between market speculation and on-chain metrics.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin Surges Past $66,000 as Crypto Markets Rally</h2>\n\n<h3>BTC Hits Highest Price Since April</h3>\nBitcoin (BTC) climbed to its highest price since April 24, surging past $66,000 for the first time in weeks. The cryptocurrency was up more than 7% over the past 24 hours, with analysts suggesting that it could target the $84,000 level in the near future.\n\n<h3>Altcoins Leading Gains</h3>\nWhile Bitcoin led the way, altcoins such as Solana (SOL) and NEAR also saw significant gains. Solana and NEAR both jumped 8% and 12% respectively, outperforming the broader market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index, which was up 6%.\n\n<h3>Market Rally Triggered by U.S. Inflation Data</h3>\nThe rally in the crypto markets was triggered by softer-than-expected U.S. inflation data released on Wednesday. April's Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures edged lower from March, easing concerns about reaccelerating inflation and a potential shift in Federal Reserve policy.\n\n<h3>Investor Confidence Boosted by Data Releases</h3>\nInvestors viewed the CPI data as a bullish sign, marking the first decrease in inflation over the last three months. Combined with the Federal Reserve's announcement of its intention to taper the balance sheet run-off, the data was seen as favorable for risk assets.\n\n<h3>Bitcoin Breaks Downtrend, Eyes New All-Time Highs</h3>\nAnalysts at Swissblock noted that Bitcoin's surge marked a break-out from a downtrend that had capped prices for weeks. The firm suggested that BTC could rally to $69,000 in the short term, with the potential to reach new all-time highs targeting the $84,000 level.\n\n<h3>Traditional Markets Also See Gains</h3>\nIn addition to the crypto rally, U.S. equities also climbed with the S&P 500 index hitting a fresh all-time high. The return of risk appetite in traditional markets further fueled optimism among investors.\n\nIn conclusion, the latest surge in Bitcoin and the broader crypto markets has ignited investor enthusiasm, with analysts predicting further upside potential for both BTC and altcoins in the coming days.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Interactive Brokers Group Launches Crypto Trading in the U.K.</h2>\n\n<h3>Expansion of Digital Asset Exposure</h3>\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR) has now launched cryptocurrency trading in the U.K. after becoming the first SFC-licensed securities broker to allow retail clients to trade cryptocurrencies in Hong Kong. With this move, the investment broker is expanding its scope of digital asset exposure.\n\n<h3>Unified Platform for Trading</h3>\nIndividual and institutional investor clients of Interactive Brokers (U.K.) Limited can now trade crypto assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash, from a single unified platform. Eligible clients can transact and view balances through a platform that provides a unified view of their securities brokerage account and crypto account at Paxos Trust Company.\n\n<h3>Competitive Pricing and Convenience</h3>\nNotably, commissions for cryptocurrency trades for IBKR’s U.K. clients are only 0.12-0.18% of the trade value, with a minimum of $1.75 per order. Clients are not charged any additional spreads, markups, or custody fees. The introduction of cryptocurrency trading allows clients to benefit from centralized cash management and trade various digital assets, along with stocks, options, futures, currencies, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc., from a single screen.\n\n<h3>Enhanced Flexibility for UK Clients</h3>\nGerald Perez, the CEO at Interactive Brokers U.K., stated, “Interactive Brokers offers a wide selection of global investment products, sophisticated technology, and competitive pricing. Introducing cryptocurrency trading gives UK clients enhanced flexibility to invest across markets and asset classes while also adding exposure to digital assets.”\n\n<h2>Current State of Cryptocurrency Trading in the U.K.</h2>\n\n<h3>Market Overview and Regulatory Changes</h3>\nIn contrast to Interactive Brokers’ expansion, other firms like JPMorgan’s retail bank, Chase, in the U.K., have decided to restrict customers’ access to cryptocurrency-related transactions due to increased scam and fraud cases. This move comes amid regulatory changes in the U.K., where marketing for crypto assets is now required to be clear, fair, and labeled with prominent risk warnings. Despite the challenges, the demand for cryptocurrencies continues to grow, prompting financial institutions like Interactive Brokers to offer new avenues for digital asset trading.\n\n<h3>Global Expansion in the Crypto Market</h3>\nThe expansion of cryptocurrency trading by Interactive Brokers in the U.K. comes at a time when other firms like Robinhood Markets, Inc. are also planning to enter the European Union market. As the industry evolves and regulations change, financial institutions are adapting to meet the demands of investors seeking exposure to digital assets. Through strategic moves and competitive offerings, companies like Interactive Brokers aim to capture a larger market share and provide clients with enhanced investment opportunities.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Forecasted by QCP Capital</h2>\n\n<p>QCP Capital has predicted a bullish momentum for bitcoin that could potentially lead to the cryptocurrency reaching its previous highs of $74,000 in the coming months. This forecast comes in the wake of a price surge experienced by BTC on May 15th, driven by increasing ETF inflows and the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showing a slight decline in inflation compared to the previous month.</p>\n\n<h3>Institutional Adoption and Bullish Momentum Insights</h3>\n\n<p>Insights shared by QCP Capital suggest that the U.S. CPI data triggered a breakout in various risk assets, pushing BTC above the $66,000 mark. The firm anticipates a continuation of this bullish momentum that could propel bitcoin back to its peak of $74,000. Notably, there has been a significant rise in buying activity, with investors purchasing 100-120k BTC Calls for December 2024.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, major asset managers like Millenium and Schonfeld have started allocating around 3% and 2% of their assets under management (AUM) to spot Bitcoin ETFs, indicating a growing institutional adoption of the primary cryptocurrency. Analysts at QCP Capital attribute these positive developments to factors such as sovereign and institutional adoption, easing inflationary pressures, and the anticipation surrounding upcoming U.S. elections, all contributing to the potential resurgence of a bull market.</p>\n\n<p>QCP Capital has recommended traders to consider strategies like the Bullish ERKO Seagulls, designed to leverage upward price movements while managing downside risks effectively. These strategies represent a low-cost way for investors to participate in bitcoin’s potential bull run. For instance, the June Seagull offers a cost-neutral approach with a maximum payout of $18,000 per BTC if the spot price remains below $88,000 at expiry.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin Surges on Inflation Data</h3>\n\n<p>On May 15, following the release of the Consumer Price Index report indicating a slight drop in inflation, bitcoin witnessed a significant surge, climbing over 7% to reach $66,567.91. This surge marked BTC’s strongest performance since March 25 and also saw the cryptocurrency surpass its 50-day moving average for the first time since April 13.</p>\n\n<p>The surge propelled bitcoin to a weekly gain of 7%, reversing a downward trend seen over the past month and a half. As per current data from CoinGecko, bitcoin is trading around $66,007, reflecting a 6% increase in the last 24 hours.</p>\n<br>"

The regulator has urged customers to prepare for the possibility that Bybit may suddenly cease to provide services to customers in France. The AMF has highlighted that Bybit is not registered as a digital asset service provider (DASP) and is therefore operating illegally in the country. Bybit has been blacklisted by the AMF since May 20, 2022, for its unauthorized activities.\n\n## Potential Legal Action and Advice for Retail Investors\n\nThe notice from the AMF also suggests a potential enforcement action against Bybit. The regulator has indicated that it reserves the right, under the terms of the Monetary and Financial Code, to take legal action to block Bybit's website. Additionally, the AMF has advised retail investors to take all necessary measures to avoid any potential loss of access to their assets in case Bybit halts its services in France.\n\n## Past Warnings and Regulatory Scrutiny\n\nThis warning from the French regulator follows a similar alert issued by Hong Kong's financial regulator earlier this year. In March, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in Hong Kong warned the public about Bybit, adding the exchange to its list of suspicious crypto exchanges. Bybit has faced regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions as well. Last year, the exchange withdrew from both Canada and the United Kingdom citing regulatory pressure.\n\nBybit has not responded to requests for comment from CoinDesk at the time of publication. It remains to be seen how the situation will unfold for Bybit in France and whether the exchange will face any further regulatory actions in the country. Retail investors are advised to exercise caution and consider alternative options for their crypto trading activities in light of these developments.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h3>Meme Coins Rally with Market Cap Up Almost 10%</h3>\n<p>After a brief dip in April, meme coins are rallying with the overall market cap up almost 10% since yesterday. Some tokens like catwifhat are up over 30% in the past 24 hours, proving that meme coins are still the clear winners of this bull run. Book of Meme is also drawing attention with a 20% price increase this week and a 50% increase this month.</p>\n\n<h3>catwifhat Trending After 33% Jump Overnight</h3>\n<p>catwifhat ($CWIF) has been one of the breakout stars of this bull run. Perfectly positioned to ride the wave of meme coin mania, the token launched in December 2023. As the market began to pick up steam truly, the token pumped more than 10,000%.</p>\n<p>One unique feature of catwifhat is its aggressive burning mechanism. 4% of every transaction is burnt which has led to more than half of the initial 78 trillion tokens being burned already. This supply-reducing feature has helped drive demand for the token which, in turn, has led to more tokens being burnt. The token is currently priced at $0.0000007837, up 13,769% since its launch.</p>\n\n<h3>BOOK OF MEME Solidifies Place in Top 10 Meme Coins</h3>\n<p>BOOK OF MEME continues to make waves since its now-infamous launch in March. Within 48 hours, the price of the token rose over 2,000%, and the market value reached more than $1 billion. The project combines memes with a decentralized storage solution. It enables the minting and trading of memes. The artist behind the project, Darkfarms, wants to preserve meme culture in a decentralized manner.</p>\n<p>BOME quickly rose into the top ten meme coins by market cap, passing hundreds of more established meme cryptocurrencies. It currently sits at number eight, and its recent price movements have shown that this token is here to stay.</p>\n\n<h3>Could WienerAI be Next to Pump? New Meme Coin Nears $2 Million in Presale</h3>\n<p>One project that combines memes with AI is currently in the middle of a fast-moving presale. WienerAI blends AI technology with a cute sausage dog to create an AI-powered trading bot. Already, its utility-driven features have drawn almost $2 million from investors.</p>\n<p>The team behind WienerAI is designing a bot with an AI interface where you can pose questions about trading strategies or investment advice. Then, the bot will scour the web to find you the best trades and prices. You’ll also be able to execute trades with zero fees, and the bot has built-in protection against front-running bots.</p>\n<p>Presale investors will also be able to stake their tokens to start earning passive income straight away. The token is currently priced at $0.000707.</p>\n<br>"

They must carefully navigate the storage, security, and accessibility of digital assets to optimize client portfolios. \n\n**The Ultimate Control with Self-Custody**\n\nFor those seeking complete control over their digital assets, self-custody is the way to go. This approach involves securing private keys through cold storage, offering maximum security but requiring technical expertise. It is ideal for individuals prioritizing absolute control over their assets.\n\n**Convenience with On-Exchange Custody**\n\nOn-exchange custody offers convenience and accessibility, allowing for swift transactions. However, it comes with security risks, as the platform's vulnerabilities can pose a threat. The collapse of FTX serves as a reminder of the importance of selecting platforms with strong security protocols and regulatory compliance.\n\n**Institutional Assurance with Off-Exchange Solutions**\n\nOff-exchange custody solutions provide additional verification layers, catering to the needs of institutional investors. This strategic approach combines old-world banking safety with new-tech efficiency, offering a secure way to manage substantial assets.\n\n**Exploring Crypto Quant Funds**\n\nVenturing into crypto quant funds presents a compelling opportunity, utilizing algorithms for high-frequency trading and market-neutral strategies. This method allows for diversified exposure to cryptocurrencies while minimizing risks associated with asset management and custody.\n\n**Navigating Regulatory Frameworks**\n\nAdvisors must also navigate the complex regulatory landscape governing digital assets, balancing compliance with strategic innovation. The political and technological nuances require a careful approach to ensure regulatory compliance while fostering innovation.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIntegrating cryptocurrencies into investment portfolios requires knowledge, strategic acumen, and an understanding of risk. Whether choosing self-custody, on-exchange custody, or off-exchange solutions, advisors must leverage these tools to achieve superior outcomes. The key lies in embracing bold, strategic innovation to optimize client portfolios in the volatile world of digital assets. \n\n**Ask an Expert**\n\nIn a Q&A session, credit fund managers discuss the challenges and considerations when selecting custodians for bitcoin collateral assets. They prioritize minimizing business risks, ensuring long-term viability and safety.\n\n**Experts' Insights**\n\nCredit managers handling bitcoin collateral explain the unique challenges of bitcoin custody and the importance of robust security protocols. They also address the possibility of insuring bitcoin assets and the reliance on security measures rather than standard insurance policies.\n\nIn conclusion, financial advisors must stay informed and adapt to the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency custody to protect and optimize client portfolios effectively.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Study Shows Link Between Fish Consumption and Mercury Exposure\n\n## Mercury Exposure and Health Risks\n\nRecent studies have shown that almost all individuals have trace amounts of methylmercury, a form of mercury, in their bodies. This is primarily due to the prevalence of mercury in the environment. While most people have levels too low to cause health issues, excessive exposure to mercury can lead to serious health risks.\n\nResearch indicates that excessive mercury exposure can result in neurodevelopmental problems in children and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease in adults. The source of this exposure is often through the consumption of fish, as fish tend to accumulate contaminants like mercury from industrial discharges in aquatic environments.\n\n## Recommended Limits and Safety Measures\n\nTo mitigate the risks associated with mercury exposure, experts recommend certain limits on fish consumption. Pregnant women are advised to avoid shark, swordfish, mackerel, and tilefish, as these species may contain higher levels of mercury that could impact fetal brain development.\n\nFor the general population, it is advised to consume no more than 170 grams of fish such as tuna or mackerel per week, and a total of 350 grams of any fish or shellfish per week. Exceeding these limits on a regular basis can increase the likelihood of elevated mercury levels in the body.\n\n## Controversy and Considerations\n\nWhile limiting fish intake can reduce mercury exposure, it also raises concerns about missing out on the health benefits associated with consuming fish, such as omega-3 fatty acids that protect against cardiovascular disease. The impact of mercury toxicity can vary based on individual genetic makeup and metabolism of toxic substances.\n\nMercury poisoning can manifest through symptoms like joint and muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, insomnia, and excessive sweating. Treatment for mercury poisoning involves medications known as chelators, which help remove mercury from the body, although this process can be time-consuming.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while fish consumption can provide essential nutrients, it is crucial to be mindful of potential mercury exposure. By following recommended guidelines and monitoring fish intake, individuals can strike a balance between reaping the benefits of fish consumption and reducing the risks associated with mercury toxicity.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Solana's Surge in Price</h2>\nSolana's native token, SOL, experienced a significant surge in price within a 24-hour period. Currently valued at $161, SOL had touched $165 earlier in the day. The token saw a remarkable 56.6% increase in trading volume, reaching $3.7 billion.\n\nAccording to CoinGecko data, SOL holds the position of the fifth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $73.1 billion.\n\n<h2>Robinhood and Infinex's Support for Solana</h2>\nThis surge in SOL's price can be attributed to recent developments involving major platforms like Robinhood, Infinex, and MarginFi. Robinhood Crypto, a digital asset trading platform, announced on May 15 that they would launch a Solana-staking feature for European users. This move was communicated through a statement on Solana's official X account.\n\nMeanwhile, Infinex, a decentralized perpetual contract trading platform by Synthetix, also declared its support for Solana. The integration of Solana into the Infinex platform has opened up new opportunities for users, with a significant amount of USDC locked in Solana on the platform.\n\n<h2>Marginfi's Liquidity Layer Announcement</h2>\nOn the same day, Marginfi revealed Solana's first Liquidity Layer, described as a new layer for performant DeFi. This Liquidity Layer offers integrated native yields, including staking yield through LST, token yield through mrgnlend, and stablecoin yield through YBX.\n\nThe overall surge in SOL's price aligns with the broader gains across the crypto market, which has seen a 4.7% increase in the last day, reaching a total market capitalization of $2.5 trillion. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $66,000 with a 5.7% increase, while Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a 3.3% increase, now trading around $3,000.\n\nIn conclusion, with major platforms like Robinhood and Infinex showing support for Solana, combined with Marginfi's innovative Liquidity Layer announcement, the future looks promising for SOL and the broader crypto market as a whole.\n<br>"

The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI), released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, showed a 0.3% increase in inflation, surpassing analyst expectations. Economists surveyed by Reuters had predicted a 0.4% gain in the CPI, in line with previous months. Year-over-year, the CPI climbed by 3.4%, slightly lower than the prior month's 3.5% increase.\n\n<h3>The Impact of CPI on Bitcoin Prices</h3>\nThe CPI has been a significant factor influencing Bitcoin prices in recent months, according to Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise Asset Management. Traders closely monitor the CPI as a lower inflation rate could signal looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. This perceived positive outcome drives Bitcoin investors to view the cryptocurrency favorably, considering its volatile nature as a high-risk asset. David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, emphasizes the strong correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500 Index as a result of the CPI's influence.\n\n<h3>Market Forces Driving Bitcoin's Uptick</h3>\nThe publication of 13F filings for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday also played a role in boosting Bitcoin prices. These filings revealed that 937 professional firms were invested in Bitcoin ETFs as of March 31, with a total exposure of $11.06 billion. The increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin signifies a shift towards greater acceptance and adoption of the cryptocurrency among traditional investors.\n\nFurthermore, a significant Bitcoin withdrawal of over $1 billion from Coinbase on Wednesday sparked interest in the market. The recipient of the 16,021 tokens remains unknown, although analysts from CryptoQuant suggest it was an institutional player behind the transaction.\n\nIn conclusion, the convergence of positive economic indicators, institutional investment, and market dynamics has propelled Bitcoin to a three-week high. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction among institutional investors, its value and prominence in the financial landscape are expected to grow further.\n<br>"

Pertsev, the co-developer of Tornado Cash, was found guilty of money laundering and was sentenced to serve 64 months in prison. The crypto community expressed outrage at the decision, with many taking to social media platforms to voice their concerns. Individuals such as Pablo Sabbatella and Alexandre Stachtchenko criticized the ruling, calling it a sad day for privacy and crypto.\n\n### Split Reactions\n\nWhile some in the crypto community saw the decision as a necessary step towards ensuring trust in the industry, others viewed it as an overreach by regulators. With global efforts to combat money laundering in the crypto space, the verdict against Pertsev highlighted the challenges faced by developers and users of anonymizing tools like Tornado Cash. The platform has been associated with criminal activities, including hacks and thefts by groups like Lazarus.\n\n### Legal and Regulatory Perspectives\n\nThe Dutch judge argued that Tornado Cash facilitated money laundering transactions, leading to Pertsev's conviction. The verdict raised concerns about compliance and regulatory issues associated with such tools. Despite the guilty verdict, some legal experts contended that a more nuanced approach is needed when addressing crimes involving decentralized technologies. The impact of Pertsev's case could extend to other developers associated with Tornado Cash, such as Roman Storm and Roman Semenov, who are facing similar charges in the U.S.\n\n### The Road Ahead\n\nAs Pertsev explores options for appealing the court's decision, the outcome of his case could set a precedent for future trials related to anonymizing tools in the crypto space. With the debate over privacy, individualism, and regulatory oversight intensifying, the legal landscape for crypto developers remains uncertain. The crypto community waits to see how Pertsev's appeal unfolds and what implications it could have for the broader industry.\n<br>"

This internal email obtained by WIRED raises concerns about the justification of the bureau’s spy powers.\n\nThe program, controversial for its past misuse by the FBI to target US protesters, journalists, and even a sitting member of Congress, was recently extended by US lawmakers for an additional two years in April. Despite this extension, concerns about the abuse of power linger.\n\n<h3>FBI's Push for Surveillance</h3>\nIn the April 20 email, Abbate urged employees to use tools like the Section 702 program to demonstrate their essentiality to the mission, while ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Representative Zoe Lofgren from California expressed concern over the FBI's apparent push for more surveillance of Americans, contradicting earlier assurances from the bureau during the program's reauthorization debate.\n\nFollowing the publication of the internal email, the FBI spokesperson Susan McKee provided a statement defending the bureau's actions and emphasizing the importance of FISA Section 702 in protecting the American people.\n\n<h3>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 702 Program</h3>\nUnder the FISA 702 program, the government can use American companies to eavesdrop on various communications without the need for a search warrant. However, at least one recipient must be a foreigner believed to be outside of the US.\n\nThe FBI director Christopher Wray has emphasized the bureau's focus on reducing the number of searches of the 702 database for information on Americans. The frequency of such searches remains unclear, with varying numbers reported over the years.\n\n<h3>Compliance and Concerns</h3>\nA review by the Justice Department found that the FBI's compliance rate with the program was around 98 percent. However, concerns remain about noncompliant searches and the lack of clarity on the exact number of queries conducted.\n\nDespite criticism from privacy advocates, the US House Intelligence Committee celebrated the extension of the Section 702 surveillance program. This event highlights ongoing debates and concerns about the surveillance of Americans under such programs.\n<br>"

This decision, coupled with the overall bullish market momentum, propelled its shares to over $250. However, recent developments have seen a significant drop in COIN's value, possibly due to increasing competition in the local market.</p>\n\n<h3>Monopoly in ETF Custodian Services</h3>\n\n<p>With Brian Armstrong at the helm, Coinbase has established itself as a monopoly in the Bitcoin ETF custodian sector, largely because it is among the few publicly-traded crypto exchanges in the US. This strategic advantage paid off during the first quarter of 2024 when the ETFs were launched, leading to a 72% surge in revenue, exceeding expectations.</p>\n\n<h3>Price Movements and Decline</h3>\n\n<p>Following the positive developments, Coinbase's shares soared from $156 at the beginning of the year to a peak of $280 in late March. However, as the market retraced in April and May, the shares maintained a level above $200. The recent slump, dropping by 9.43% from $215 to $199, suggests external factors influencing the decline rather than market movements.</p>\n\n<p>It is speculated that increased competition in the spot trading arena within the US market is a significant factor. CME Group, a prominent player in futures trading, announced plans to introduce spot BTC trading, posing a potential threat to established platforms like Coinbase and Binance. Additionally, Ark Invest, led by Cathie Wood, has been gradually selling off COIN shares, adding to the selling pressure.</p>\n\n<p>While the broader crypto market, led by BTC reaching a new all-time high, remains bullish, Coinbase's recent struggles highlight the challenges of maintaining dominance in a rapidly evolving industry. With emerging competitors and shifting investor sentiments, the coming months will be critical for Coinbase as it navigates this new landscape.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Restaking: A Revolutionary Approach to Utilizing Staked Cryptocurrency\n\n### Introduction to Restaking\nIn the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technology, new mechanisms and protocols are continuously being developed to enhance the efficiency and security of existing and future crypto projects. One such innovative mechanism is restaking, which allows users to utilize their staked cryptocurrency across multiple protocols simultaneously. This not only boosts reward potential but also significantly enhances the security and scalability of blockchain networks, benefiting the entire crypto ecosystem.\n\n### Staking and Proof-of-Stake\nTo understand restaking, it's crucial to first understand the concept of staking within the context of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain networks. PoS is a method used to keep blockchain networks safe and ensure that transactions are correct. Validators (or stakers) lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to secure the network and participate in block creation and validation processes. This staked cryptocurrency acts as collateral to ensure validators act in the network's best interest.\n\n### What is Restaking?\nRestaking allows validators to redeploy their staked cryptocurrency across multiple PoS-based services simultaneously. This means that the same staked assets can secure multiple platforms, extending their utility and potential rewards. Restaking addresses limitations of traditional staking such as limited reward generation and shared network security.\n\n### Types of Restaking\nRestaking can be categorized into two types: native restaking and liquid restaking. Users can engage in native restaking if they operate their own validator, while liquid restaking involves using Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) to participate in restaking platforms conveniently.\n\n### How Restaking Works\nIn both native and liquid restaking, the core idea is to maximize the use of staked assets by securing multiple protocols simultaneously. Validators earn additional rewards by participating in restaking, either through native restaking where they run their validator node or liquid restaking where they use liquid staking tokens.\n\n### Advantages of Restaking\nRestaking offers increased flexibility, enhanced reward potential, scalable security, and improved security for new protocols. It allows validators to access liquidity while maintaining the potential for rewards, generate multiple streams of income, and scale network security based on demand.\n\n### Disadvantages and Risks of Restaking\nWhile restaking presents numerous advantages, it also comes with risks such as centralization risk, compounded slashing risk, smart contract vulnerabilities, and counterparty risk. Validators must be aware of these risks before engaging in restaking activities.\n\n### Examples of Restaking Protocols\nEigenLayer on Ethereum is a prominent example of a restaking protocol. Other restaking protocols in early development include Picasso on Solana and Octopus 2.0 on Near.\n\n### The Next Steps for Restaking\nRestaking addresses key limitations in the traditional staking model and offers a groundbreaking way for users to maximize their staked cryptocurrency across various protocols simultaneously. With the potential for increased rewards and enhanced security, restaking is set to revolutionize the way we interact with blockchain networks in the crypto ecosystem.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin Derivatives Traders Anticipate Short-Term Correction Despite Soft Inflation</h2>\n\n<h3>Premium for Downside Protection</h3>\nCF Benchmarks' analysis of Bitcoin (BTC) futures options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) indicates that investors are willing to pay a premium for short-term downside protection, even after the recent softer U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report. Despite Bitcoin's surge above $66,000 post-inflation data release, there is a higher implied volatility for out-of-the-money (OTM) put options compared to calls, signaling a bearish short-term sentiment among derivatives traders.\n\n<h3>Optimistic Long-Term View</h3>\nWhile the short-term outlook seems bearish, analysts observe a \"flatter\" volatility curve for longer-dated puts and calls, slightly skewed towards calls, suggesting a more positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The analysts speculate that the skew towards calls may increase in the event of expectations of disinflation acceleration post the favorable CPI report.\n\n<h2>CME Group Contemplates Launching Bitcoin Spot Trading</h2>\n\n<h3>Potential Expansion</h3>\nAccording to reports from the Financial Times, the CME Group is reportedly considering the introduction of Bitcoin spot trading alongside its existing futures products. This move aims to cater to traders seeking a regulated platform for cryptocurrency trading. The addition of spot trading on CME would enable traders to profit from basis trades by exploiting price disparities between futures contracts and the spot price of the underlying asset. However, the finalization of this plan is still pending.\n\nOverall, the derivatives market reveals a cautious short-term approach towards Bitcoin, with traders hedging against potential value decline. On the other hand, the possibility of CME expanding into spot trading reflects growing interest and demand for regulated cryptocurrency trading platforms among investors. The dynamics of the Bitcoin market continue to evolve, influenced by both economic indicators and innovations within the financial sector.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Russia and Other Foreign Actors Amplifying Disinformation Around US Campus Protests\n\n## Covert Doppelganger Campaign Echoes Russian Narratives\nThe covert Doppelganger campaign, believed to be originating from Russia, has been spreading disinformation around the ongoing campus protests in the United States. The disinformation campaign echoed narratives promoted by overt Russian channels, such as Telegram groups and state-run media outlets. These channels have been highlighting the \"threat of deadly police violence against demonstrators\" and connecting the current protests to the Kent State protests in 1970 when four students were shot and killed by the National Guard.\n\n## Amplification on Social Media Platforms\nOn Facebook, Sputnik, a Russian state media outlet, wrote about how US lawmakers are restricting students' rights to peaceful protest, citing their crack down on student protests against the violence in the Gaza Strip. Similarly, on Telegram, Russian influencers with substantial followings have been amplifying content related to the protests. One military blogger with over 800,000 followers posted videos showing police presence on campuses across the US, misleadingly claiming it showed \"urban warfare training.\"\n\n## Coordination and Narrative\nThe channels on Telegram seem to coordinate around a narrative that accuses the US government of hypocrisy when it comes to freedom of protest and organization. This analysis was shared with WIRED by Logically, a company that specializes in tracking disinformation campaigns. The disinformation campaign is believed to be using the 2024 US election as a focal point for spreading their false narratives.\n\n## Collaboration with Other Countries\nRussia is not the only foreign actor involved in spreading disinformation about the protests. China and Iran have also been active in producing articles in English to shape the narrative around the protests. State media from these countries have collectively generated nearly 400 articles in just two weeks. Additionally, the three governments have been using social media platforms to boost their narratives about the protests.\n\n## US-Based Far-Right Figures Involved\nWhile foreign actors continue to spread disinformation, US-based far-right figures have also played a role in amplifying conspiracies about the protests. Some of these conspiracies involve accusations of funding from figures like George Soros. However, Russia is now taking advantage of these preexisting theories and expanding them for their own agenda, including supporting Trump and criticizing Biden.\n\nIn conclusion, the ongoing campus protests in the US have become a battleground for information warfare, with foreign actors and domestic figures alike shaping the narrative to suit their interests.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Senate to Vote on Resolution to Invalidate SEC Accounting Bulletin</h2>\n\n<h3>Sources Predict Democrat Support for Joint Resolution 109</h3>\nThe US Senate is set to vote on Joint Resolution 109 on Thursday, with sources indicating that there is a belief it will garner enough Democrat support to pass. The resolution, which cleared the House of Representatives last week with bipartisan backing, seeks to overturn the Security and Exchange Commission’s contentious Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121.\n\n<h3>Controversy Surrounding SAB 121</h3>\nIntroduced in March 2022 and enacted the following month, SAB 121 stipulates that digital asset custodians must report a liability and corresponding assets on their balance sheets for all custodied cryptocurrencies. While not an official agency rule, SEC staff justified the bulletin as a measure to mitigate risks associated with safeguarding crypto assets.\n\n<h3>Political Landscape and Senator's Stance</h3>\nIn the House, where Republicans hold the majority, 21 Democrats voted in favor of the resolution. The Senate, on the other hand, requires a simple majority for passage, necessitating at least two Democrats and all Republican Senators to support it. Sources familiar with the matter revealed that multiple Democratic senators plan to vote affirmatively.\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand, a long-time advocate for cryptocurrency, publicly announced her backing for Joint Resolution 109. She criticized SAB 121 for bypassing proper consultation with regulatory agencies and Congress, and for deviating from established accounting standards. Gillibrand stressed that the bulletin would restrict consumer options and weaken consumer protection in bankruptcy scenarios.\n\n<h3>Last-Ditch Efforts and Potential Consequences</h3>\nRepresentative Wiley Nickel of North Carolina sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler, urging the withdrawal of SAB 121 ahead of the Senate vote. Nickel emphasized the issue's non-partisan nature and the importance of bipartisan collaboration in the custodial banking sector. The White House indicated that President Joe Biden would veto the legislation if it reaches his desk.\n\nSEC Chair Gensler defended SAB 121, asserting its alignment with US bankruptcy court precedents. He highlighted the accountability of liabilities on balance sheets, citing previous court rulings that crypto assets are not immune to bankruptcy claims. The SEC has yet to respond to requests for comments on the matter.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>MIT Graduates Arrested for $25 Million Crypto Crime</h2>\n\n<h3>The Scheme</h3>\nAnton and James Peraire-Bueno, both in their twenties, devised a scheme that allowed them to pocket a whopping $25 million in just 12 seconds. The brothers, graduates of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with elite computer skills, utilized their knowledge to carry out the crime. Their illegal activities were discovered by federal authorities, who described the case as something out of a pulp novel.\n\n<h3>The Investigation</h3>\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and IRS agents were quick to crack down on the alleged crime committed by the Peraire-Bueno brothers. The masterminds behind the crime were no match for the prosecutors and investigators who utilized cutting-edge technology and traditional investigative methods to solve the case.\n\n<h3>The Crime</h3>\nThe sophisticated crime involved a new type of illegal activity on the Ethereum blockchain known as Maximum Extractable Value (MEV). MEV allows those constructing the blockchain to profit from others' transactions by packaging them in a block in a specific way. The Peraire-Bueno brothers went a step further by exploiting a bug in popular software used for MEV, enabling them to manipulate and steal from Ethereum users' transactions.\n\n<h3>The Aftermath</h3>\nWhile MEV itself is not illegal and has been present in the crypto industry for some time, the Peraire-Bueno brothers' actions have drawn attention to the murky practice. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for individuals with advanced degrees, as even MIT graduates are not immune to making poor decisions. Moreover, evidence revealed that the brothers had searched online for information related to money laundering and financial fraud, highlighting the importance of discretion in criminal activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the case of the MIT graduates arrested for a $25 million crypto crime sheds light on the potential risks associated with exploiting loopholes in blockchain technology. The incident underscores the need for increased scrutiny of MEV practices and may lead to calls for reforms within the Ethereum community. Ultimately, the Peraire-Bueno brothers' downfall serves as a reminder that no amount of education or technical expertise can protect individuals from the consequences of engaging in illegal activities.\n<br>"

However, it has currently reclaimed the $66,000 level, showcasing resilience in the market.</p>\n\n<h3>BTC Back to $66K</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin faced a challenging end to the previous business week as its price dropped to just above $60,000. Despite the downward trend, the asset managed to bounce back over the weekend and especially on Monday. The bullish momentum continued into the current week, propelling Bitcoin to over $63,000 initially. After a minor setback to $61,200 due to Coinbase issues, the asset surged on Wednesday following the US announcement of the CPI numbers for April.</p>\n<p>With increasing inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs on Wednesday and Thursday, BTC's price reached a three-week high above $66,500. Although there was a minor retracement, the price has climbed back above $66,000 amidst positive ETF flows for the fourth consecutive day. The market cap of Bitcoin maintains its position slightly above $1.3 trillion, although its dominance over altcoins has decreased to 51.7%.</p>\n\n<h3>LINK Skyrockets After 18% Surge</h3>\n<p>While several altcoins experienced a rally, LINK took the spotlight with a significant 18% surge. The total crypto market cap remains above $2.5 trillion on CG, indicating a stable trend in the market. Most alternative coins witnessed green movement similar to Bitcoin, with notable gains seen in Ethereum, Ripple, SOL, ADA, AVAX, DOT, BCH, HBAR, and ICP.</p>\n<p>Chainlink, however, outperformed other large-cap altcoins by skyrocketing more than 18% in just one day, surpassing $16 in trading value. Despite minor declines in some altcoins like BNB, DOGE, TON, TRX, and SHIB, the overall market sentiment remains positive following Bitcoin's surge.</p>\n<br>"

This innovative solution promises to revolutionize the way users interact with decentralized applications and exchange platforms.\n\n### What is zkSync?\nzkSync is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum that uses zero-knowledge proofs to increase transaction speed and reduce fees. By offloading transactions from the main Ethereum chain to a secondary layer, zkSync is able to greatly improve the scalability and efficiency of the network.\n\n### Benefits of Using zkSync\nOne of the main advantages of zkSync is its ability to significantly reduce transaction costs. By processing transactions off-chain and only periodically settling them on the Ethereum mainnet, users can avoid high gas fees and enjoy near-instant transaction speeds. This makes zkSync an ideal solution for users who want to interact with decentralized applications but are wary of the high costs associated with using the Ethereum network.\n\n### The zkSync Bridge\nThe new bridge to zkSync is set to make it even easier for users to take advantage of the benefits offered by this innovative scaling solution. By providing a seamless connection between the Ethereum mainnet and zkSync, the bridge allows users to move tokens and assets between the two networks with ease. This will open up new opportunities for developers and users alike, making it easier than ever to leverage the power of zkSync for various applications.\n\n### Community Reaction\nThe announcement of the zkSync bridge has sparked a wave of excitement within the crypto community, with many users eager to get their hands on this new solution. Developers are already planning to integrate zkSync into their applications, while users are looking forward to the prospect of lower fees and faster transactions. Overall, the community is optimistic about the potential impact of the zkSync bridge and the opportunities it will create for the future of decentralized finance.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Bitcoin Miner Hut 8 Upgraded to Buy by Craig-Hallum\n\n## Hut 8's Substantial Capital for Future Projects\n\nIn a recent research report, broker Craig-Hallum highlighted the advantageous position of Bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT), which currently holds more than 9,100 bitcoins. This sizable stack of coins gives the company a significant amount of capital to utilize for upcoming projects, according to the report.\n\nThe analyst team, led by George Sutton, emphasized the value of Hut 8's bitcoin reserves, which account for approximately 75% of its current market capitalization. They described it as not only a protective feature for investors but also as highly opportunistic capital that the company can use for growth initiatives.\n\n## Upgrade in Ratings and Price Target\n\nFollowing the positive evaluation of Hut 8's financial position, Craig-Hallum upgraded the stock from hold to buy. The broker maintained a price target of $12 for the stock while reiterating its optimistic outlook on the company's future prospects.\n\nIn response to the upgrade, shares of Hut 8 surged over 13% to $8.83 during Wednesday's trading session, buoyed by a notable increase in the price of Bitcoin. The positive momentum carried over to Thursday, with the stock continuing to trade higher by 2% in early market activity.\n\n## Diversified Business Model and Strategic Opportunities\n\nThe report also highlighted the company's expanding pipeline, which includes not just bitcoin mining opportunities but also high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) ventures. Hut 8 is poised to enter the AI services market later this year, with an anticipated annual revenue of $20 million from a new contract.\n\nMoreover, Hut 8's strategic partnerships with key energy providers and progress in the regulatory inquiry process were noted as factors that could further enhance its growth potential. The acquisition of Validus assets, comprising four natural gas power plants in Ontario, is expected to bolster the company's cash reserves, according to the broker.\n\nWith the recent release of first-quarter earnings, Hut 8 reported a significant increase in net income, reaching $250.9 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period the previous year. These developments signal a promising outlook for Hut 8 as it continues to solidify its position in the cryptocurrency market and diversify its business operations.\n<br>"

He acknowledged Larsen's belief in Ripple's potential well before himself.</p>\n\n<p>Chris Larsen, one of the co-founders of Ripple Labs, served as the CEO until 2016 when Brad Garlinghouse took over the position.</p>\n\n<p>In December 2020, Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen faced legal action from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly raising over $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. However, the SEC dropped charges against the executives in October 2023, marking a significant victory for Ripple.</p>\n\n<p>The legal battle has progressed into the trial phase, with both parties presenting necessary documents and following court rules. Jeremy Hogan, an American lawyer, stated that the briefs stage has been completed, and now they await the judge's ruling.</p>\n\n<h2>Brad Garlinghouse's Key Contributions to Ripple</h2>\n\n<p>According to John E Deaton, a prominent US attorney supporting thousands of XRP investors in the legal case against the SEC, Brad Garlinghouse has played a pivotal role in Ripple's legal successes. Deaton believes that Garlinghouse should be recognized as a crucial figure in Ripple's achievements in the legal sphere.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, Deaton suggested that Garlinghouse should be considered for the title of \"CEO of the decade\" if Ripple decides to go public in the coming years. Garlinghouse's leadership and contributions to Ripple's advancements have been acknowledged by industry experts and legal professionals.</p>\n<br>"

The two entities completed the first live test of tokenised deposits using blockchain technology, marking a crucial step forward in exploring the potential of blockchain in revolutionising banking transactions and asset management.\n\nIn this groundbreaking initiative, the Mastercard Multi-Token Network (MTN) played a pivotal role. The live test transaction involved a Mox Bank client purchasing a carbon credit, which was subsequently tokenised by SCBHK using Libeara, its innovative tokenization platform. Through the use of blockchain technology, an atomic swap facilitated the seamless transfer of the tokenised deposit and the carbon credit, securely delivering the tokenised asset to the client’s digital wallet. This proof of concept not only showcases the technical feasibility of tokenised deposits but also highlights the potential for enhancing transaction efficiency, transparency, and security within the financial industry.\n\nHelena Chen, the Managing Director of Mastercard for Hong Kong and Macau, emphasizes the importance of partnerships with industry leaders like SCBHK and innovative platforms like Libeara in driving transformative applications that reshape consumer-business interactions.\n\n<h3>Standard Chartered Hong Kong embracing digital assets</h3>\nThe successful completion of this live test aligns with the forward-looking initiatives of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), particularly through projects such as Project Ensemble. Ensemble aims to explore wholesale Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenised deposits, underscoring Hong Kong’s commitment to embracing blockchain and digital assets within its financial ecosystem.\n\nStandard Chartered Hong Kong’s active involvement in Ensemble, as well as in eHKD retail CBDC trials and multi-CBDC cross-border payment projects like mBridge, further cements the momentum towards digital transformation in finance. Mary Huen, CEO of Standard Chartered Hong Kong, stresses the pivotal role of tokenization in shaping the future of the financial industry.\n\nThrough collaboration with key partners like Mox Bank, Libeara, and Mastercard, Standard Chartered Hong Kong aims to drive the adoption of tokenization in financial assets under the guidance of HKMA. This pioneering spirit not only positions Hong Kong as a hub for fintech innovation but also sets the stage for broader adoption of blockchain-based solutions globally.\n<br>"

His associate, 27-year-old Colin Murphy, was charged with fraud, as announced by the Ontario Securities Commission on Wednesday.\n\nThe criminal charges, stemming from a 16-month investigation known as Project Swan, come as a surprise to many following the ongoing bankruptcy case linked to the alleged scheme, which has been heavily covered by the media in Canada.\n\n### The Allegations\n\nCourt documents and local media reports indicate that between 2021 and 2022, approximately 160 investors entrusted Pleterski and his company, AP Private Equity Limited, with $40 million in Canadian dollars ($30 million USD) to invest on their behalf in the crypto and foreign exchange markets. Some investors even took out loans to participate in the scheme.\n\nThe trustee overseeing the bankruptcy case found that Pleterski only invested 2% of the funds received, spending at least $16 million on personal luxuries like luxury cars, international travel, and a leased $8.4 million lakefront mansion. Assets such as two McLarens, two BMWs, and a Lamborghini were seized during the bankruptcy process.\n\n### Alleged Kidnapping and Aftermath\n\nIn a bizarre twist, Pleterski was reportedly kidnapped, beaten, and tortured in December 2022 by five victims of his alleged Ponzi scheme. After three days of captivity, he was released following a ransom demand to his landlord-turned-mentor.\n\nPleterski's troubles continued as NBA player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who had purchased the mansion linked to Pleterski, faced threats related to the property and sought to back out of the purchase.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nPleterski was released on $100,000 bail, with conditions that include surrendering his passport, refraining from discussing financial matters on social media, and avoiding crypto trading. The Ontario Securities Commission has promised further updates on the case.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>A Mbodied Questional</h2>\n<p>Following an interview with Julia Ostroukhova, the self-proclaimed leader of the Cyber Army of Russia, several questions have arisen regarding the group's actual ties and intentions. One particular statement made by Julia sparked confusion regarding the relationship between the Cyber Army of Russia and the Sandworm hacker group. While Julia mentioned a shared commander-in-chief overseeing both groups, it remains unclear whether this implies a shared leader, an ideological connection, or a hierarchical structure.</p>\n<h3>Russian Linkages</h3>\n<p>Experts in Russian information warfare and influence operations who reviewed the interview noted that despite claims of independence, the Cyber Army of Russia aligns closely with the Russian government and military's rhetoric. Their advocacy for influencing civilian infrastructure beyond conflict lines mirrors concepts outlined in Russian military doctrine. Furthermore, Julia's statements on cultural conservatism and non-traditional sexual relations echo sentiments expressed by Russian leaders and state media.</p>\n<p>Gavin Wilde, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, suggests that the Cyber Army of Russia's comments may be an attempt to garner support from potential government sponsors in Moscow. The group's emphasis on messaging geared towards domestic and political benefactors rather than a Western audience indicates a strategic move to align with Russian interests.</p>\n<h3>Begging for Government Support</h3>\n<p>During the interview, Julia explicitly expressed her desire for official government backing for the Cyber Army of Russia. She expressed hopes for financial support and the establishment of cyber troops within the Russian Armed Forces. This plea for governmental endorsement suggests the group's aspiration for a more formal relationship with state authorities.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, despite claiming to influence Western politics, the Cyber Army of Russia posts exclusively in Russian on its Telegram channel. This departure from other Russian influence operations, such as Guccifer 2.0 and DCLeaks, which communicated in English, raises questions about the group's true motives and target audience.</p>\n<br>"

The exchange is working on developing a service specifically targeting this segment, revealed Asia-Pacific Managing Director John O’Loghlen. Self-managed super funds in Australia make up around a quarter of the country's $2.5 trillion pension system, with an impressive A$1 billion ($664 million) already allocated to cryptoassets, as per the latest Australian Taxation Office data.\n\n### Increasing Interest in Cryptoassets\nWith inflows into self-managed retirement funds on the rise and Bitcoin's price surging by 55% this year, cryptoassets held within these funds are set to reach record levels. However, traditional institutional money managers in Australia have been hesitant to venture into the digital asset sector due to its past scandals and high volatility.\n\n### Coinbase's Offering for Self-Managed Funds\nIn an interview, O’Loghlen explained how self-managed super funds typically make a single allocation and leave it untouched. Coinbase aims to cater to these clients by providing them with a specialized offering that allows them to trade and stay with the platform. The debut of US spot-Bitcoin exchange-traded funds earlier this year has been a significant boost for the crypto market, leading to an all-time peak in March.\n\n### Overcoming Obstacles\nDespite the growing interest in cryptoassets, there are still concerns about the risks associated with this speculative market. Financial advisers like Michael Houlihan advise caution and recommend keeping crypto holdings limited, especially for younger investors with lower account balances.\n\n### Competitors Eyeing the Self-Managed Opportunity\nNot only Coinbase but also global rivals like Kraken and local players such as BTC Markets Pty and Independent Reserve Pty are looking to tap into the self-managed pensions sector. These platforms are focusing on building relationships with financial advisers and developing tools to attract clients that hold self-managed super funds.\n\n### Future Development in Australia\nAs Australia gears up to introduce more crypto ETFs before the end of 2024, industry experts anticipate continued growth in the crypto market. ASX Ltd. is expected to approve the first spot-Bitcoin ETFs for the main board in the coming months, signaling a positive outlook for the industry.\n\nWith the crypto landscape evolving rapidly, Coinbase and its competitors are gearing up to seize opportunities in Australia's self-managed pensions sector.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Apple's New Pencil Pro Raises Concerns Among Users\n\n## Compatibility Issues with Older iPad Models\n\nThe release of Apple's new Pencil Pro has left some users feeling frustrated due to its limited compatibility with older iPad models. The new stylus is only compatible with the latest 2024 iPad Pro and iPad Air models, leaving users of older devices unable to use the new accessory.\n\nUsers who have invested in the 2022 iPad Pro, which was released two years ago at a significant cost, are disappointed to find that they cannot use the new Pencil Pro with their device. To make matters worse, even users looking to upgrade to the newer models from older iPads will also face compatibility issues with their existing second-gen Apple Pencil.\n\n## Lack of Backward Compatibility\n\nApple's decision to restrict the compatibility of the new stylus to only the latest models has raised concerns among users. The lack of backward compatibility means that users will need to invest in a new Pencil Pro if they want to use it with the new iPad Pro or iPad Air.\n\nWhile Apple has introduced a \"new magnetic interface\" for the Pencil Pro, there are no significant improvements in terms of charging speed, pairing, or magnet strength compared to the previous model. This move has left many questioning why such a simple accessory like a stylus cannot be made backward compatible with older devices.\n\n## Performance Concerns and User Frustrations\n\nSome users speculate that the lack of compatibility may be due to processing power limitations on older iPad models. However, if the M2 chipset in the 2022 iPad Pro is already struggling to handle the new stylus features, it raises concerns about the performance capabilities of Apple's silicon.\n\nOverall, users are frustrated with the limited compatibility of the new Pencil Pro and believe that Apple should ensure that all their current lineup of devices support at least the second-gen Apple Pencil, Pencil Pro, and USB-C Apple Pencil. The unnecessary complexity of having multiple stylus options only adds to the confusion and frustration among users.\n\nIn conclusion, the lack of compatibility with older devices contradicts Apple's motto of \"it just works\" and has left many users feeling disappointed with the company's decision.\n<br>"

This uptrend comes after a period of stagnation and uncertainty in the market post-halving.</p>\n<p>The latest data suggests that the $60,000 price level has emerged as a crucial support zone for Bitcoin. This support is reinforced by the accumulation of new whales - addresses holding over 1,000 BTC for less than 6 months - and the steady position of long-term holders.</p>\n\n<h3>New Whales Favor $60,000 Support</h3>\n<p>CryptoQuant's recent findings indicate that new whales have been accumulating Bitcoin around the $60,000 level. These new whales, attracted by the influx of institutional investors following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US, have established $60,000 as a key support level on-chain.</p>\n<p>The average acquisition cost for these new whales stands at $60,000, showcasing their confidence in entering the market and the strength of this price level as a solid floor for Bitcoin. The introduction of institutional capital from spot ETFs has further validated $60,000 as a critical support zone.</p>\n\n<h3>Stability Among Long-Term Whales</h3>\n<p>On the flip side, long-term whales - who have held over 1,000 BTC for more than 6 months - have demonstrated a stable realized price. This stability reflects their experienced strategies and long-term accumulation approach, indicating a strong confidence in Bitcoin's enduring value despite short-term market fluctuations.</p>\n\n<h2>Increased Liquidity Supports Bullish Sentiment</h2>\n<p>Accompanying the market-wide recovery is a surge in the volume of stablecoins entering the market. This increase in stablecoin inflows has coincided with Bitcoin's price fluctuations, pointing towards enhanced liquidity in the market.</p>\n<p>Heightened liquidity levels are crucial for sustaining the ongoing uptrend, further bolstering the bullish narrative surrounding Bitcoin's recent rebound.</p>\n\n<p>As Bitcoin continues to show resilience and gain momentum above $60,000, investors are closely monitoring these key support levels and market dynamics to gauge the sustainability of the current bullish trend.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Hedge Funds and Asset Managers Ramp Up Investments in Bitcoin ETFs</h2>\n\n<h3>New York-based Hedge Funds Leads the Way</h3>\nIn a recent surge of interest, several hedge funds and asset managers have been acquiring stakes in the newly launched U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to the price of bitcoin. Among these institutions is Millennium Management LLC, based in New York, which revealed a staggering $2 billion investment in various bitcoin ETFs by the end of the first quarter of the year.\n\n<h3>Investment Trends in Bitcoin ETFs</h3>\nMillennium's portfolio includes positions in well-known funds such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, as well as offerings from issuers like Bitwise Investments and ARK Investment Management. Other notable purchasers in this trend have been Boston-based hedge fund manager Bracebridge Capital, which held $262 million in the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and $81 million in the BlackRock product.\n\n<h3>Wisconsin Investment Board's Involvement</h3>\nThe state of Wisconsin's investment board, responsible for managing $156 billion in assets for the Wisconsin Retirement System, also disclosed significant purchases in the bitcoin ETF space. The board revealed holdings of over $99 million in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and more than $63 million in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\n\n<h3>Engagement from Retail Investors</h3>\nWhile hedge funds have taken substantial positions in bitcoin ETFs, retail investors, including investment advisors, remain a dominant force in this market. Hightower Advisors, a prominent advisory firm, disclosed holdings of approximately $68 million in bitcoin ETFs, showcasing the widespread appeal of these products across different investor segments.\n\n<h3>Continued Growth Expected</h3>\nAs the trend towards bitcoin ETF investments continues to gain traction, experts anticipate further growth in institutional ownership. According to Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise, as many as 700 institutions may own $5 billion or more in bitcoin ETFs once all filings are processed. This surge in interest has not only helped drive the price of bitcoin to new highs but has also highlighted the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments.\n\nAs the market evolves, regulators and investors alike will be closely monitoring the impact of these investments on the broader financial ecosystem.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Senators Propose Funding for Affordable Connectivity Program</h2>\n\n<h3>New Plan to Revive the Affordable Connectivity Program</h3>\nA new plan has been proposed by a bipartisan group of senators to revive the Affordable Connectivity Program, an initiative that provides discounts on high-speed internet access to low-income households in the United States. At the end of April, funding for the program was set to run out, affecting millions of households. \n\n<h3>Proposal for Funding</h3>\nThe group of senators, led by Ben Ray Luján of New Mexico, have proposed using a Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization measure as a vehicle for funding the ACP and other telecom programs, with a combined $6 billion. The coalition includes senators J.D. Vance, Peter Welch, Jacky Rosen, Steve Daines, and Roger Wicker. Luján emphasized the importance of the program, stating that over 23 million households and 55 million people are currently benefiting from it.\n\n<h3>Inclusion of FCC's \"Rip and Replace\" Program</h3>\nThe proposed measure also includes a provision for the Federal Communication Commission’s “rip and replace program,” which refunds US telecom providers for removing equipment from Chinese manufacturers like Huawei and ZTE from their networks. The FCC has requested around $2 billion from Congress to bolster the program, which has faced a shortfall. This initiative has been in place since 2020 when Huawei and ZTE were identified as national security threats.\n\n<h3>Support from the Biden Administration</h3>\nThe Biden administration has shown support for the expansion of broadband access and significant investments in the ACP. President Biden has called on Congress to reinvest in the program, highlighting the necessity of high-speed internet access in today's society. It is crucial to adequately fund the “rip-and-replace” program to ensure national security and empower the FCC to reauction spectrum licenses for better internet connectivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed funding for the Affordable Connectivity Program and the inclusion of the “rip-and-replace” program aim to address the digital divide and ensure access to high-speed internet for all households, especially those in low-income communities.\n<br>"

The decision to leverage blockchain technology was spurred by the sharp increase in gold prices, which surged by more than 13% in May 2024, reaching unprecedented levels in history.\n\n<h3>Blockchain Technology Enhances Accessibility</h3>\nDigital gold tokens serve as a cryptographic representation of gold's value, directly linked to physical gold reserves. This innovative approach allows investors to own digital shares of gold, thereby bridging the gap between physical and digital assets. The utilization of blockchain technology not only simplifies the process for traditional investors but also facilitates seamless buying and selling on cryptocurrency exchanges. Additionally, it enhances data transparency, traceability, and provides robust security measures against potential hacking or theft.\n\n<h3>Facilitating Gold Transactions Through Cryptocurrency</h3>\nThe collaboration between Pundi X Labs and Scoin enables users to easily purchase and distribute gold on an exchange platform using cryptocurrency technology. This strategic partnership not only marks a significant milestone for Pundi in its quest to tokenize and dematerialize finance but also highlights the growing importance of gold tokens as established investment tools within the realm of cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe integration of blockchain technology in the gold market represents a progressive step towards enhancing accessibility, transparency, and security for investors worldwide. With the partnership between Pundi X Labs and Scoin, the exchange of physical and digital gold is bound to become more seamless and efficient, reshaping the traditional landscape of gold investments.\n\nImage: The Block\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>### Cryptocurrency Sui Emerges as Potential Ethereum Competitor\n\nSince its launch nearly a decade ago, Ethereum has become one of the most successful crypto investments, with a market valuation of $354 billion. With its rise to the top, Ethereum has dominated the blockchain world, becoming the second most valuable crypto globally. Now, a new cryptocurrency, Sui, is starting to gain attention as a potential Ethereum competitor.\n\n#### What is Sui and Why Should You Care?\n\nSui, pronounced \"swee,\" is a Layer 1 blockchain like Ethereum, but it claims to be faster, more efficient, and cheaper to use. With the potential to handle 297,000 transactions per second, Sui offers low latency and 100% uptime, making it ideal for decentralized finance and Web3 gaming. The founding team of Sui includes executives and developers from Facebook, adding credibility to the project.\n\nThe Sui blockchain officially launched in May 2023, making it a relatively new player in the blockchain space. Despite being a newcomer, Sui has attracted over $300 million in investments from venture capitalists, indicating strong support for its potential to succeed.\n\n#### Sui's Mobile Crypto Strategy and Growth Potential\n\nSui's upcoming catalyst for 2025 is the launch of a new handheld gaming device, SuiPlay0x1, integrated with the Sui blockchain. The device, priced around $500, will offer games from Sui and other partners. Early reviews suggest positive feedback, but the success of the product remains uncertain.\n\nEthereum's meteoric rise from less than $1 to an all-time high of $4,892 demonstrates the potential for cryptocurrencies to grow exponentially. Sui, currently trading around $1, has the potential to mimic Ethereum's growth trajectory if its mobile crypto strategy resonates with users.\n\nWith the ambitious goal of capturing market share in key blockchain niches, Sui has the potential to rival Ethereum in the long run. While challenges exist in dethroning Ethereum as the market leader, Sui's innovative approach and backing from experienced technologists make it a cryptocurrency worth monitoring.\n\n#### Should You Invest in Sui?\n\nAs of now, Sui trades around $1, making it an affordable entry point for investors looking to capitalize on its growth potential. Whether Sui can achieve Ethereum-like success remains to be seen, but with the right strategy and market adoption, there's no telling how high Sui's value could soar in the future. For investors seeking opportunities in the crypto space, Sui presents an intriguing possibility to capitalize on the next big thing in blockchain technology.\n<br>"

Despite the oppressive heat, Mara is suffering from a cold that has spread through the mosquito-infested camp. She left Berlin to live among the pine trees in an effort to stop the company from expanding.\n\n<h3>Upcoming Protest</h3>\nThis week, Mara will be joined by the notorious German climate group, Here And No Further (Ende Gelände), for a five-day-long protest against Tesla. Anticipating hundreds of demonstrators, Tesla announced it would shut down the factory for four days. This decision prompted the employees to work from home, according to an internal email obtained by the German newspaper, Handelsblatt.\n\n<h3>Protest Preparations</h3>\nDespite the absence of Tesla workers, the company employees and local authorities are on high alert for potential troublemakers. The factory is only separated from the forest by a thin fence. Police cars patrol the area, and security measures are visibly increased around the factory perimeter.\n\n<h3>The Anti-Tesla Movement</h3>\nMara estimates that there are 50 to 100 people involved in the anti-Tesla movement. Yet, the forest camp appears quiet on a Thursday afternoon. Treehouses above the camp provide shelter, and activists display their political beliefs through banners hanging from the trees.\n\n<h3>The Environmental Impact</h3>\nThe protesters argue that Tesla's presence in Germany poses a threat to local water supplies and democracy. They believe that Tesla's ambition to produce 1 million electric cars a year is a byproduct of \"green capitalism,\" designed to maintain consumerism under the guise of environmental friendliness.\n\n<h3>Symbol of Protest</h3>\nTo Mara and others, Tesla represents a symbol of how the green transition has been distorted. As a result, the German gigafactory has become the target of increasingly radical protests. Activists moved into the forest to physically block Tesla from expanding, and in a separate incident, unknown saboteurs blew up a nearby power line, forcing the factory to close for a week.\n\nIn conclusion, Mara and her fellow activists are determined to make their voices heard and challenge Tesla's expansion plans in Germany.\n<br>"

However, the meme coin sector had few exceptions, with Doland Tremp (TREMP) standing out by surging 60% in the last 24 hours to reach a new all-time high of $1.07 according to CoinGecko.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"TREMP-Price.png\" alt=\"TREMP Price\"/>\n<figcaption>TREMP Price, Source: CoinGecko</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<h3>Trump's Campaign News</h3>\n\n<p>The surge in TREMP, a coin themed around former US President Donald Trump, coincides with major developments in his campaign. Reports indicate that Trump leads in five out of six crucial swing states, positioning himself as a strong contender against current President Joe Biden in the upcoming November elections.</p>\n\n<p>Swing states play a vital role in US presidential elections as they are neither dominantly Republican nor Democrat, making them crucial battlegrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Another significant event related to Trump is the hush-money trial involving Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film actress who alleged an affair with Trump before his 2016 election. Trump has denied the allegations, and his defense has raised questions about the credibility of witnesses in the trial.</p>\n\n<h2>Trump's Pro-Crypto Stance</h2>\n\n<p>While in office, Trump was critical of cryptocurrencies, but his stance has softened in 2024. He now describes himself as the candidate for pro-crypto voters, contrasting himself with Biden and his cabinet, who are seen as anti-crypto.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I can live with it. If you are in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These comments were followed by a price surge in another meme coin associated with him, MAGA (TRUMP), which set a new all-time high over $10 on May 16.</p>\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"TRUMP-Price.png\" alt=\"TRUMP Price\"/>\n<figcaption>TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>"

Bitcoin surged past $66,000 for the first time since April 24, while altcoins like Solana and NEAR led the gains.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin and Altcoin Performance</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin reached its highest price since April 24 and was up more than 7% over the past 24 hours. On the other hand, Ether changed hands near $3,000 with a 4% advance. Solana and NEAR saw significant gains of 8% and 12% respectively. The CoinDesk 20 Index also showed a 6% increase.</p>\n\n<h3>Market Reaction to U.S. Inflation Data</h3>\n<p>The rally was triggered by April U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures, which were lower than March, along with a slightly sluggish retail sales report. This data came as a relief for investors, easing fears of reaccelerating inflation and a hot economy prompting the Federal Reserve to reconsider its policies.</p>\n\n<p>Bitfinex analysts noted that the decrease in CPI inflation over the last three months, combined with the Fed's intention to taper its balance sheet run-off, was seen as positive for risk assets.</p>\n\n<h3>Traditional Market Response</h3>\n<p>U.S. equities also climbed on the same day, with the S&P 500 index reaching a new all-time high, showcasing a return in risk appetite among investors.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin's Breakout</h3>\n<p>Today's surge in Bitcoin marked a break-out from a downtrend that had capped prices in recent weeks. Swissblock analysts said this move opened the way for BTC to potentially target $69,000 and even reach new all-time highs at $84,000. The breakout also signals a positive trend for altcoins, which are expected to follow strongly in the next leg up.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MwcmhWLh2sJhYe5.u9rsdQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcyMA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/coindesk_$75/82c21fb1874cb6ce9d5468e2739695cc\" alt=\"Bitcoin breakout from a downward trend\">\n  <figcaption>Bitcoin broke out from a downward trend that capped prices during previous rallies.

              "__cdata": "<br>## FCC Releases Final Net Neutrality Order\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unveiled its final net neutrality order on Tuesday, making significant adjustments from the draft version to prevent internet service providers from circumventing fast-lane bans.\n\n### Ensuring Fair Practices\n\nIn an interview with WIRED, a senior FCC official disclosed that the final order includes provisions to prohibit paid fast lanes in consumer-facing products, ensuring compliance with the agency’s rules. Additionally, providers are barred from disguising consumer products as enterprise offerings to evade regulations.\n\n### Net Neutrality Reinstated\n\nIn April, the FCC reinstated net neutrality rules, reclassifying broadband as a “common carrier” service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. This move aims to prevent ISPs like AT&T and Verizon from engaging in blocking, throttling, or implementing pay-to-play fast lanes for online services.\n\n### Challenges and Criticisms\n\nCritics raised concerns that the draft rules did not adequately address emerging technologies such as 5G and network slicing. Telecom executives argued that network slicing, which involves segmenting a network into varying speed tiers, should be exempt from fast lane restrictions.\n\n### Balancing Innovation and Regulation\n\nDespite the potential benefits of network slicing for industries like autonomous vehicles and remote surgery equipment, the FCC emphasized that efforts to circumvent net neutrality requirements would not be tolerated. This stance aims to ensure fair competition and consumer protection in the evolving digital landscape.\n\n### Addressing State Initiatives\n\nThe final order also addresses concerns about preempting state-led efforts to promote broadband affordability. A recent federal appeals court decision overturned a ruling preventing New York from enforcing a law mandating low-cost broadband programs. The FCC confirmed that its rules would not interfere with New York’s program or similar initiatives in other states.\n\nIn conclusion, the FCC’s final net neutrality order seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumer interests in an increasingly complex digital environment.\n<br>"

The digital currency's price trajectory mirrored the unfolding developments in the financial landscape.</p>\n\n<h3>Fluctuations in BTC Price</h3>\n<p>BTC displayed a pattern of ups and downs correlated to significant occurrences throughout the day. Initially, Bitcoin witnessed an uptick in value prior to the release of the Producer Price Index (PPI) data. However, its trajectory shifted downwards during Federal Reserve (FED) President Jerome Powell's speech. The cryptocurrency then experienced a resurgence following reports that the US state of Wisconsin had made an investment in a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).</p>\n\n<p>As Bitcoin continued its volatile movements, the focus shifted to the eagerly anticipated inflation data from the United States.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Inflation Figures Revealed</h3>\n<p>The highly awaited inflation data was finally unveiled, drawing attention to vital metrics:</p>\n\n<p><em>Consumer Price Index Monthly:</em> Announced 0.3% | Expected 0.4% | Previous 0.4%</p>\n<p><em>Consumer Price Index Annual:</em> Announced 3.4% | Expected 3.4% | Previous 3.5%</p>\n<p><em>Core Consumer Price Index Monthly:</em> Announced 0.3% | Expected 0.3% | Previous 0.4%</p>\n<p><em>Core Consumer Price Index Annual:</em> Announced 3.6% | Expected 3.6% | Previous 3.8%</p>\n\n<p>The consumer price index serves as a crucial gauge for tracking shifts in consumer spending trends and inflation rates within the US economy.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, a higher-than-anticipated figure typically signifies a bullish sentiment for the US dollar, whereas a lower-than-forecasted number may portend a bearish tone for the greenback.</p>\n\n<h2>Impacts of CPI Data on Bitcoin and Dollar</h2>\n<p>In the aftermath of the release of CPI data, both Bitcoin and the US Dollar (DXY) responded in distinct ways to the revealed statistics, shaping their respective price movements in the market.</p>\n\n<img src=\"https://cnews24.ru/uploads/7ac/7acb538866d1d57b47031b85c90016b4b31d98ae.jpeg\" size=\"1600x954\"/>\n\n<p>*Kindly note that the information provided does not constitute investment advice.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Path to Millionaire Status</h2>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin's Growth Trajectory and the Spot ETFs</h3>\n\nSince its inception 15 years ago, Bitcoin has seen an incredible increase of over 18,000% in value, creating numerous millionaires along the way. Now, with the approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2024, investing in Bitcoin has become as simple as buying a stock through a brokerage account.\n\nThese spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin, making it easier for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency's potential for wealth creation. With Bitcoin still in the early stages of adoption, analysts compare its current stage to the early days of the internet, suggesting a similar wealth-creating opportunity.\n\nAdditionally, the approval of these ETFs has attracted institutional investors to the Bitcoin market, further increasing demand and putting pressure on Bitcoin's limited supply.\n\n<h3>Understanding the Effect of Fees</h3>\n\nWhile investing in Bitcoin directly may offer the best growth potential, spot Bitcoin ETFs are a viable option for those looking to reach millionaire status. However, investors must be mindful of the fees associated with these ETFs.\n\nEach Bitcoin ETF charges fees for its services, ranging from 0.19% to 1.5%. These fees can have a significant impact on an investor's returns over time. For example, a hypothetical scenario shows that a difference of 1% in fees can lead to a $3 million gap in returns over 30 years.\n\n<h3>Striking a Balance with AUM</h3>\n\nIn addition to fees, investors should consider assets under management (AUM) when choosing a Bitcoin ETF. ETFs with higher AUM tend to have greater liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell shares without impacting the price significantly. Funds with larger AUM also have access to more resources and experienced portfolio managers, which can improve tracking performance and reduce errors.\n\nCurrently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has the highest AUM at over $18 billion, while BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund offer a balance between AUM and fees.\n\n<h3>Becoming a Millionaire</h3>\n\nWith Bitcoin's potential for future growth and the accessibility of spot Bitcoin ETFs, investors have a straightforward path to becoming millionaires through cryptocurrency investments. By striking a balance between fees and AUM, investors can maximize their returns and capitalize on Bitcoin's wealth-creating abilities.\n<br>"

The initiative, as detailed in a report by DTCC, aimed to simplify the tokenization process of traditional finance funds using Chainlink’s CCIP protocol, ultimately promoting broader institutional adoption of blockchain technology.</p>\n\n<p>The successful completion of the pilot demonstrated the effective delivery of structured data on-chain and integration into various on-chain use cases, such as tokenized funds and bulk consumer smart contracts. The project showcased the potential for real-time, automated data dissemination and access to historical data, enhancing efficiency, speed of settlements, and transparency in operational processes.</p>\n\n<p>Following the announcement of the pilot's success, Chainlink's LINK token saw a positive response, with its price surging over 18% and exceeding $16 for the first time since April 12. At the time of writing, the token is trading at $16.5, with a daily trading volume of slightly over $1 billion, signaling a 195.4% increase in the past 24 hours.</p>\n\n<figure id=\"attachment_332347\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-332347\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\n    <img class=\"size-full wp-image-332347\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAxODM1IDgxOSIgd2lkdGg9IjE4MzUiIGhlaWdodD0iODE5Ij5saW5rdXBpZnkgaW1hZ2U8L3N2Zz4=\" alt=\"LINK/Price/Chart 17.05.2024.

This innovative system, which underlies all cryptocurrencies, has changed the way we think about financial transactions. \n\n<h3>Transparency and Security</h3>\nOne of the key features of blockchain technology is transparency. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, making it virtually impossible to alter or tamper with. This level of security has made blockchain technology the preferred choice for many industries, from finance to healthcare.\n\n<h3>Decentralization and Peer-to-Peer Trading</h3>\nUnlike traditional banking systems, which rely on a central authority to verify transactions, blockchain technology is decentralized. This means that transactions are verified by a network of users, rather than a single institution. This peer-to-peer trading system has eliminated the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.\n\n<h3>The Future of Blockchain Technology</h3>\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve, new applications and use cases are constantly being explored. From supply chain management to voting systems, the potential uses of blockchain are limitless. With major companies such as IBM and Microsoft investing heavily in blockchain research, the future looks bright for this revolutionary technology.\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\nIn conclusion, blockchain technology is not just the backbone of cryptocurrencies, but also a game-changer in the world of digital transactions. Its unparalleled security, transparency, and decentralization make it the ideal solution for a wide range of industries. As we look towards the future, it is clear that blockchain technology will play a crucial role in shaping the world of tomorrow.\n<br>"

The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the siblings with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, alleging that they exploited the etherum blockchain to siphon off $25 million from unsuspecting traders. The indictment revealed that the duo, who are alumni of a prestigious university in the U.S., used their expertise in math and computer science to access and manipulate pending transactions, diverting the stolen assets into their own accounts and employing multiple methods to conceal their tracks.\n\n## The Swift Heist\nThe Pepaire-Bueno brothers meticulously planned the scheme for months, but the execution of the heist itself only took a mere 12 seconds. Additionally, after successfully acquiring the stolen cryptocurrency, the pair repeatedly rebuffed requests to return the funds, as per the allegations outlined in the indictment.\n\n## Facing the Consequences\nU.S. Attorney Damian Williams for the Southern District of New York emphasized the unprecedented nature of the case, highlighting that the brothers used their specialized skills to interfere with the protocols relied upon by numerous Ethereum users worldwide. He underscored the novelty of the brothers' alleged scheme, stating that it had never before been prosecuted. As a result of their actions, James and Anton were scheduled for separate court appearances in their respective cities before U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul G. Levenson for the District of Massachusetts and U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie Figueredo for the Southern District of New York. In the event of a conviction, the brothers could each face up to 20 years in federal prison for each of the charges brought against them.\n\n## Conclusion\nRegardless of the scheme's sophistication or the novel techniques employed, Williams declared that the prosecutors would relentlessly pursue individuals who undermine the integrity of financial systems. The case serves as a stark reminder that fraudulent activities within the cryptocurrency sphere will not go unpunished.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>**PEPE Bull Run Turns $3,000 Investment Into $46M Fortune**\n\nIn a remarkable turn of events, a trader has reportedly made an astonishing profit of over $46 million from their investment in the meme coin Pepe (PEPE) in the past year. This success story has captured the attention of mainstream media, pointing towards the potential growth of meme coins like Dogeverse (DOGEVERSE) following in the footsteps of PEPE.\n\nThe journey began last April when the trader made a modest $3,000 investment to purchase 4.9 trillion PEPE tokens, back when the coin was still an obscure asset in the meme coin market. As the meme mania took hold of the industry, PEPE's price skyrocketed, leading the trader to strategically sell a portion of their tokens and realize a profit of approximately $7.4 million by selling 1.41 trillion PEPE tokens.\n\nDespite the substantial sales, the trader still holds 3.5 trillion tokens valued at nearly $39 million, resulting in an overall transformation of the initial $3,000 investment into a staggering $46 million windfall. This incredible return illustrates the wealth-building potential that meme coins can offer to savvy investors.\n\n**PEPE Hits New All-Time High as Speculative Demand Ramps Up**\n\nThe recent week has been extraordinary for PEPE as it experienced a surge in price, increasing by 39% between Monday and Wednesday, culminating in a new all-time high of $0.0000115. This rally was influenced by the resurgence of interest in meme assets triggered by the return of Keith Gill, popularly known as \"Roaring Kitty\" from the GameStop saga.\n\nAlthough PEPE has retraced by 12% from its peak, the token is still holding strong at around $0.0000101. With spot trading volumes reaching $1.9 billion, PEPE currently ranks as the ninth most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing the trading volumes of established assets like Dogecoin and XRP. Additionally, open interest in PEPE perpetual futures has surged to over $114 million as speculators jump into the market.\n\n**Could New Meme Coin Dogeverse Give Similar Gains? Analysts See 100x Potential**\n\nWhile PEPE continues to dominate the meme coin scene, analysts have started focusing on the potential of a new contender, Dogeverse. This project combines the trend of meme coins with cross-chain interoperability, allowing DOGEVERSE holders to swiftly move tokens across six different blockchain networks.\n\nFurthermore, Dogeverse offers a staking protocol providing token holders with 55% annual yields, attracting significant interest from investors. The project has already raised over $15 million in its presale, drawing attention from industry experts who predict a potential 100x increase in value once listed on decentralized exchanges. As excitement builds around Dogeverse, it stands as a prime example of the evolving landscape of meme coin investments.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>Bitcoin Correlation with Tech Stocks on the Rise\n\n### Bitcoin and Tech Stocks\nBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now being compared to high-growth assets such as technology company shares, as optimism grows over a potential reduction in borrowing costs. During the Federal Reserve's last tightening cycle, Bitcoin was considered a speculative investment and slumped as higher interest rates were expected to reduce risk appetite. However, recent trading patterns show a different story.\n\n### Correlation Coefficient\nThe 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index reached 0.46 this week, the highest level since late August. This suggests that the assets are moving more in sync, compared to earlier when the Fed started raising interest rates in early 2022. This correlation has drawn attention to Bitcoin as a growth asset or an asset representing network value.\n\n### Bitcoin as an Uncorrelated Asset\nBitcoin proponents have long promoted the coin as an uncorrelated asset, detached from governmental influences. Created in 2008 with the goal of being a decentralized currency outside the control of central banks, Bitcoin has been hailed as a digital alternative to gold, an inflation hedge, and a store of value. However, its price volatility has challenged these narratives over the years.\n\n### Impact of US ETFs\nThe approval of US exchange-traded funds holding Bitcoin has opened up the cryptocurrency to a new category of investors. Since the ETFs went live in January, Bitcoin surged to a record high of almost $74,000 in March. It has continued to rise, with a 10% increase this week and a 58% jump year-to-date, outpacing the Nasdaq 100.\n\n### Future Outlook and Fed's Influence\nAs the Fed signals a potential reduction in borrowing costs, Bitcoin advocates anticipate a positive impact on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. With inflation easing and Fed officials cautious about rate cuts, the macroeconomic landscape will play a significant role in shaping Bitcoin's trajectory.\n\n### Uncertainty Ahead\nWhile Bitcoin has shown resilience and growth post-US ETFs, the potential impact of Fed rate cuts remains uncertain. Whether Bitcoin will continue to be viewed as a risky or alternative asset by traditional markets will be a key factor to watch in the coming months.\n\nIn conclusion, Bitcoin's correlation with tech stocks highlights its evolving nature as an asset class, influenced by macroeconomic factors and investor sentiment in the broader market.\n<br>"

At the time of reporting, it was trading around $66,440, up 0.4% from 24 hours earlier. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which provides a broader view of the digital asset market, was up approximately 1.4%. There has been a resurgence in inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs, with four consecutive days of positive additions. Institutional players like Morgan Stanley have also disclosed significant investments in BTC ETFs, with Morgan Stanley revealing a $269.9 million stake in Grayscale's GBTC.</p>\n\n<h2>Ether Potential Upside</h2>\n<p>While Ether may have lagged other major digital assets this year, Coinbase suggests that it has the potential for a surprising upside. According to a research report, Ether does not face significant supply side pressures and benefits from staking and layer 2 growth as liquidity sinks. The coin's position in the DeFi ecosystem is strong due to widespread adoption of the EVM and layer 2 innovations. Coinbase also highlighted the potential impact of approved spot U.S. ETH ETFs.</p>\n\n<h2>Fantom's Rise</h2>\n<p>The Fantom blockchain's native token FTM has been one of the standout performers in the past week, gaining 13% to reach around 81 cents. This rise is attributed to positive sentiment around the Sonic upgrade and growth in total value locked on the protocol. Fantom Foundation's latest upgrade, Sonic, is expected to increase transaction speeds to 2,000 transactions per second with a 1.1-second finality, a significant improvement from the previous month's 2.5 TPS.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin Hodler Net Position Change</h2>\n<p>The \"hodler net position change\" for Bitcoin, which measures the net buying/selling activity of addresses holding coins for six months or more, has turned positive for the first time since December. This shift indicates that long-term holders have become net buyers, signaling a positive sentiment in the market. The data is sourced from Glassnode.</p>\n<br>"

Last Friday, bitcoin was struggling to stay above $60,000, facing downward pressure. However, the situation has changed drastically since then.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin's Price Movement</h3>\n<p>The shift began over the weekend when BTC managed to hold above $60,000 and even increased slightly to around $61,000. The real breakthrough came on Monday when the cryptocurrency surged to just over $63,000. Despite a brief retracement on Tuesday due to Coinbase issues and anticipation of the US CPI announcement, bitcoin quickly bounced back.</p>\n\n<p>Following the release of the US CPI data, which met expectations, bitcoin witnessed a rapid climb. The price soared above $66,500, driven by increased inflows to ETFs. While there was a minor dip yesterday, with BTC dropping below $65,000, the upward trend resumed today. As a result, bitcoin crossed the $66,000 mark, marking its best performance since early March and reigniting investor enthusiasm.</p>\n\n<h3>Market Data</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Market Cap: $2.533T | 24H Vol: $78B | BTC Dominance: 51.6%</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">BTC: $66,455 (+5.35%) | ETH: $3,086 (+2.1%) | BNB: $580 (-2.61%)</p>\n\n<h2>Top Crypto Headlines of the Week</h2>\n<p><strong>Bitcoin’s Strong Fundamentals: Bitfinex Report</strong>: Despite recent fluctuations, Bitfinex highlighted the robust fundamentals of the Bitcoin network in a report, emphasizing its resilience despite minor setbacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ethereum Struggles Against Bitcoin</strong>: ETH has failed to keep pace with BTC's gains, leading to a widening gap between the two cryptocurrencies and dampening hopes of a potential 'flippening' event.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Morgan Stanley's Investment in Grayscale's GBTC</strong>: Major US firms, including Morgan Stanley, disclosed substantial investments in Bitcoin ETFs during the first quarter, signaling growing institutional interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Wisconsin State Board's $164 Million BTC Investment</strong>: The Wisconsin State Investment Board's significant allocation to Bitcoin ETFs raises speculation about similar moves by other state entities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CME Group's Foray into Spot Bitcoin Trading</strong>: CME Group, a traditional finance powerhouse, is exploring entry into the spot Bitcoin trading market, potentially intensifying competition in the sector.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shiba Inu's ShibaSwap 2.0 Launch</strong>: The migration of ShibaSwap to Shibarium, Shiba Inu's Layer 2 blockchain, signifies ongoing developments in the ecosystem.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Institutional Demand and Risk Appetite Could Send Bitcoin Soaring</h2>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin Set to Break All-Time Highs</h3>\nBitcoin may be on the cusp of surpassing its all-time highs of $74,000 as early as next week, thanks to increasing institutional demand and a growing risk appetite for assets. Traders are optimistic about the potential for the leading cryptocurrency to make significant gains in the coming days.\n\n<h3>Positive Sentiment Boosting Prices</h3>\nThe U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin have experienced four consecutive days of inflows, with BlackRock's IBIT receiving a substantial $94 million on Thursday. This influx of capital suggests a shift in investment sentiment towards digital assets.\n\nAlex Kuptsikevich, FxPro senior market analyst, shared his insights, stating that Bitcoin is already rebounding and could surpass $70,000 over the weekend if global risk appetite remains strong. He predicts that a test of the $71,000 to $74,000 price range could happen as early as next week, potentially igniting a new wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) among investors.\n\n<h3>Institutional Investors Driving Demand</h3>\nThe positive outlook for Bitcoin comes as U.S.-listed spot ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency recorded significant inflows, totaling $257 million by Thursday. This surge in interest marks a drastic shift from previous weeks when some of the largest ETFs saw no inflows on certain days.\n\nBlackRock's IBIT stood out with the largest inflow of $94 million, while Grayscale's GBTC also received over $4.6 million in inflows after experiencing a period of outflows since January. Multiple regulatory filings have revealed that major funds like Millennium Management and Elliot Capital hold substantial investments in Bitcoin ETFs, further bolstering confidence in the digital asset.\n\n<h3>CPI Data Impacting Market Movement</h3>\nThe recent softer-than-expected U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which rose 0.3% compared to 0.4% in March, has also influenced Bitcoin's price movement. This news triggered a breakout for BTC on Wednesday, propelling it past the $66,000 mark for the first time since April and resulting in the largest single-day gain since March.\n\nAs Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest and positive market sentiment, many traders are optimistic about its potential to reach new highs and attract additional investments in the near future.\n<br>"

To prevent further damage, Pump.fun took immediate action by halting trading and updating their contracts.</p>\n\n<h3>Flash Loan Exploit</h3>\n\n<p>Pump.fun revealed that the former employee exploited their privileged position by accessing the withdrawal authority they had obtained during their time with the company. Using flash loans on a Solana lending protocol, the individual borrowed SOL and manipulated coin prices to 100% on bonding curves, allowing them to access liquidity and repay the loans. Trading on the platform was halted soon after, impacting about $1.9 million out of $45 million in total liquidity. The team redeployed contracts and resumed trading with a 0% fee for the next seven days.</p>\n\n<p>The affected tokens that reached 100% during the exploit are currently untradeable until liquidity pools are set up for them on the Solana lending protocol, Raydium. Pump.fun assured users that they would replenish the liquidity pools for the affected coins with an equal or greater amount of SOL within the next 24 hours to compensate for the loss.</p>\n\n<h3>Internal Private Key Leak</h3>\n\n<p>Prior to Pump.fun's announcement, Wintermute's head of research, Igor Igamberdiev, linked the hack to an internal private key leak and suspected a user named \"STACCoverflow.\" Subsequently, user \"Stacc\" admitted to executing the exploit, citing dissatisfaction with their superiors at Pump.fun and criticizing them as unfit for the blockchain community.</p>\n\n<p>The team at Pump.fun is working diligently to resume trading safely and has sought assistance from renowned security experts to prevent similar incidents in the future. Despite the setback, they remain committed to ensuring the security and integrity of their platform for all users.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Chinese Nationals Charged in $73 Million Cryptocurrency Scam</h2>\n\n<h3>Arrests and Charges</h3>\nIn a recent development, U.S. authorities have charged two Chinese nationals in a cryptocurrency scam that laundered at least $73 million from defrauded victims, according to the Justice Department. Yicheng Zhang was arrested in Los Angeles, while Daren Li, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis, was arrested at the Atlanta airport in April.\n\n<h3>Allegations and Accusations</h3>\nThe U.S. has accused the two individuals of being involved in a type of cryptocurrency investment scam known as pig butchering, which has emerged as a billion-dollar industry worldwide. The defendants allegedly instructed co-conspirators to open U.S. bank accounts under the guise of shell companies.\n\n<h3>Modus Operandi and Money Laundering</h3>\nThe victims were lured online into depositing their funds into these accounts, which were then used for money laundering through U.S. financial institutions to bank accounts located in the Bahamas. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco highlighted the reach of the law in combating fraud in the crypto markets.\n\n<h3>Charges and Potential Sentencing</h3>\nLi and Zhang are facing charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and six counts of international money laundering. If convicted, they could each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison for each count, as per the Justice Department. The crackdown on such fraudulent activities underscores the authorities' commitment to upholding the law in the emerging cryptocurrency landscape.\n\nThe news of the Chinese nationals' involvement in the cryptocurrency scam serves as a reminder of the risks associated with digital investments and the importance of due diligence in vetting financial opportunities. As the case unfolds, the impact of such scams on unsuspecting investors and the broader financial system remains a topic of scrutiny and concern.\n<br>"

The bulls are now gearing up to possibly set a new record high in the coming weeks, but the question remains - will they succeed?</p>\n\n<h2><b>Technical Analysis by TradingRage</b></h2>\n\n<h3><b>The Daily Chart</b></h3>\n\n<p>Bitcoin's daily price action has been exhibiting a corrective behavior, with lower highs and lows since the drop from $75K. The market was in a corrective phase within a descending channel rather than a full bearish reversal. However, the price has recently broken above the channel's midline and is heading towards testing the upper boundary. A bullish breakout above the descending channel could signal a rally to higher levels.</p>\n\n<h3><b>The 4-Hour Chart</b></h3>\n\n<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, the price has broken above the midline of the descending channel and retested it. Currently aiming for the $68K resistance level, a breakout above this point could lead to a rally towards the $75K all-time high. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) above 50%, the bullish momentum is strong, making these targets achievable.</p>\n\n<h2><b>On-Chain Analysis by TradingRage</b></h2>\n\n<h3><b>Bitcoin Exchange Reserve</b></h3>\n\n<p>During the recent price drop below $60K, many investors panicked and sold their coins to mitigate losses. This behavior is reflected in the exchange reserve chart, which showed a rise above the 30-day moving average as investors deposited coins to exchanges for selling. However, as the market climbed back above $60K, reserves dropped below the moving average, indicating investors withdrawing coins in anticipation of a longer price rally.</p>\n\n<p>This trend could lead to a supply shock, reducing selling pressure and potentially driving Bitcoin's price higher towards a new record high.</p>\n\n<p>\n<Figure><center>\n[Image Source: TradingView]\n</center></figure></p>\n<br>"

At the time of writing, bitcoin was trading at $67,250, marking a 2.8% increase over the past 24 hours and a 10% rise from its recent lows on Monday. This uptick in price was seen across the broader CoinDesk 20 Index, which recorded a 4.4% increase over the past 24 hours and a 12% rise from Monday's lows.\n\n<h3>Chainlink Leads the Way</h3>\nOne of the standout performers in the cryptocurrency market was Chainlink (LINK), which saw an 18% increase following the announcement of a pilot project with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) and major U.S. financial institutions. Other top performers included ether (ETH) with a 5.3% gain and solana (SOL) with a 7.7% increase.\n\n<h3>Sentiment Shifts in Crypto Market</h3>\nThe sudden surge in cryptocurrency prices comes on the back of recent economic data showing a softening in U.S. inflation. Additionally, regulatory filings revealed a significant interest in spot bitcoin ETFs, with Izzy Englander's Millennium Management disclosing a $2 billion position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Paul Singer's Elliott Management also revealing substantial bitcoin ETF holdings.\n\nThe State of Wisconsin Investment Board, responsible for managing the state's retirement assets, was also revealed to have a stake of approximately $100 million in BlackRock's IBIT. These developments have renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market, leading to a bullish sentiment among investors.\n\nWith the price of bitcoin breaking through the $67,000 barrier and other cryptocurrencies showing strong gains, the animal spirits in the cryptocurrency market have returned after a prolonged period of sideways movement. As investors keep a close eye on market developments and economic indicators, the future of the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain but filled with possibilities.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Trump-Themed Memecoin Outpace Bitcoin This Week\n\n## Memecoins Gain Momentum in 2024\nThe year 2024 has been dominated by the rise of memecoins in the cryptocurrency market. Numerous new tokens have emerged, with some showcasing impressive gains of thousands of percent. The buzz surrounding memecoins shows no signs of slowing down as these tokens continue their upward trajectory, surpassing the broader cryptocurrency market.\n\n## Shiba Inu, Pepe, and MAGA Coin Outperform Bitcoin\nNotably, memecoins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and MAGA Coin have surpassed Bitcoin in performance this past week. These memecoins, known for their meme-centric approach and minimal utility for investors, have garnered significant attention and buying activity. Shiba Inu, established in August 2020, has seen its price rise by over 7%, pushing its market cap above $14 billion. Pepe, a token based on the iconic Pepe meme, has climbed to the top 25 tokens by market cap, with a total value exceeding $4 billion and a price increase of over 17% this week. MAGA Coin, launched in August 2023, has surged by nearly 70% in 2024.\n\n## Bitcoin's Performance and Market Trends\nWhile memecoins take the spotlight, Bitcoin also experienced growth this week. Positive news surrounding inflation and comments from former President Donald Trump regarding cryptocurrency adoption contributed to Bitcoin's price surge from $60,000 to over $66,000, marking a 6% increase. Despite Bitcoin's performance, memecoins have collectively outperformed the leading cryptocurrency. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, in comparison, saw modest gains of around 2% to 2.5% this week.\n\n## Conclusion\nAs memecoins continue to attract investors and fuel market excitement, their outperformance against Bitcoin highlights the ongoing trend in the crypto space. While the broader market remains volatile, memecoins like Shiba Inu, Pepe, and MAGA Coin demonstrate the influence of memes and community-driven narratives in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape in 2024.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin Shows Highest Daily Gains In 2 Months, Jack Dorsey Predicts Price Will Surpass $1 Million</h2>\n\n<h3>Jack Dorsey's Shifting Focus</h3>\nFormer Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, known for leading X (formerly Twitter) from 2015 to 2021, has now turned his attention to the world of cryptocurrency. He has co-founded Block, Inc. (formerly Square) and served on the board of directors for Bluesky, a decentralized social media platform. In a recent interview, Dorsey shared his thoughts on the future of Bitcoin.\n\n<h3>Dorsey's Views on Decentralization</h3>\nIn the interview, Dorsey explained his decision to leave Bluesky's board and delete his profile on the platform. He criticized the \"moderation tools\" used by the company, stating that they were repeating mistakes made during his time at Twitter. He expressed disappointment that the company had shifted away from its original vision of decentralization and open-source protocols.\n\n<h3>Dorsey's Bold Prediction for Bitcoin</h3>\nWhen asked about where the price of Bitcoin could be in 2030, Dorsey made a bold prediction. He stated, \"I don’t know. Over... at least a million.\" Dorsey believes that the price of Bitcoin will surpass $1 million and continue to rise beyond that. He emphasized the collaborative effort within the Bitcoin ecosystem, noting that every individual who contributes to its improvement ultimately drives up the price.\n\n<h3>Market Implications</h3>\nIf Dorsey's prediction were to come true, it would represent a price increase of over 1,400% by 2030. This would result in a market capitalization of over $19.7 trillion, comparable to the total market cap of the Nasdaq 100 index. However, widespread adoption would be essential for such a significant price surge to occur.\n\n<h3>Industry Reactions</h3>\nDorsey is not alone in his optimistic price prediction for Bitcoin. Other prominent figures in the crypto industry, such as ARK Invest CEO, have also put forth ambitious targets for the cryptocurrency. While not all investors may share Dorsey's confidence in Bitcoin reaching $1 million, his unique perspective as a developer brings an insightful view to the discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, while Dorsey's $1 million price target for Bitcoin may seem far-fetched to some, it sparks intriguing conversations about the future of the cryptocurrency market. Regardless of the outcome, Dorsey's insights shed light on the transformative power of collaborative efforts within the crypto ecosystem.\n\nThis narrative is based on an article published by Benzinga.com.\n<br>"

She believes that Bitcoin is a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation.</p>\n<p>Senator Lummis, who represents Wyoming and serves on the Senate Banking Committee, is actively pushing for laws that support the cryptocurrency market. She aims to create a regulatory framework that promotes innovation in the crypto space while ensuring consumer protection.</p>\n\n<h3>Legislation Passed to Overturn SEC Rule</h3>\n<p>The Senate passed legislation, known as H.J.Res. 109, that targets the overturning of the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 121. This rule places strict limitations on financial institutions, preventing them from offering custody services for digital assets like Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Senator Lummis has been a vocal advocate for overturning SAB 121, criticizing it as a rule disguised as accounting guidance that was implemented without full commission approval.</p>\n\n<h3>Concerns Raised Over DOJ Interpretation of Regulations</h3>\n<p>Recently, Senator Lummis and Senator Ron Wyden wrote a letter to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland expressing concerns about the Department of Justice's interpretation of regulations related to \"money transmission.\" They argued that this interpretation could have negative implications for crypto networks and innovation in the financial sector.</p>\n\n<h2>White House Opposes Legislation</h2>\n<p>Despite the Senate's approval of H.J.Res. 109, the White House has expressed opposition to the legislation. President Biden has stated that he would veto the bill if it reaches his desk. The White House believes that overturning SAB 121 could jeopardize investor protection in the crypto market and pose risks to the financial system.</p>\n<p>Critics of SAB 121 argue that the rule is overly restrictive and hinders financial institutions from meeting the growing demand for cryptocurrency services. They believe that these institutions have the necessary compliance frameworks and security measures to handle digital asset custody effectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Uncertain Future for Bitcoin Legislation</h2>\n<p>While the Senate has approved the legislation, its fate remains uncertain due to the potential presidential veto. President Biden has the option to veto the bill, sign it into law, or take no action, allowing it to become law without his signature. The outcome will determine the future of regulations surrounding financial institutions' custody of digital assets.</p>\n<br>"

This increase comes as the animal spirits in the cryptocurrency market return after several weeks of sideways or downward movement.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin Trading at $67,250</h3>\n\n<p>Currently, bitcoin is trading at $67,250, reflecting a 2.8% increase over the past 24 hours. This marks a 10% rise from its lowest levels earlier in the week. In comparison, the broader CoinDesk 20 Index has surged 4.4% over the past 24 hours and has also rebounded about 12% from its recent low.</p>\n\n<h3>Chainlink Jumps 18% Following DTCC Announcement</h3>\n\n<p>One of the notable movers in the index is Chainlink (LINK), which has seen an 18% increase. This surge comes after the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) recently announced the completion of a pilot project with Chainlink and several major U.S. financial institutions, with the goal of accelerating the tokenization of funds. Other top performers today include ether (ETH) with a 5.3% gain and solana (SOL) rising by 7.7%.</p>\n\n<h3>Surge in Crypto Sentiment</h3>\n\n<p>The recent shift in sentiment within the crypto market follows softer U.S. inflation data and increasing interest in bitcoin ETFs. Notably, Izzy Englander's Millennium Management disclosed a $2 billion position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), while Paul Singer's Elliott Management also revealed their bitcoin ETF holdings. Additionally, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board disclosed a significant stake in BlackRock's IBIT.</p>\n\n<p>The positive market sentiment in crypto is further supported by regulatory filings showing growing interest in bitcoin ETFs and a softening in U.S. economic data. This combination has led to a resurgence in prices across various cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin leading the way with its recent uptick above $67,000.</p>\n<br>"

This achievement reflects the growing interest in Penguiana within the crypto and meme coin communities. Inspired by the playful and community-driven nature of penguins, Penguiana aims to be more than just another meme coin. It is positioning itself as a key player in the Solana ecosystem, leveraging the blockchain's speed and low fees to attract both crypto enthusiasts and meme coin aficionados.</p>\n\n<h3>$PENGU Token and Its Utility</h3>\n\n<p>At the core of Penguiana is the $PENGU token, with a total supply of 100 million tokens. 60% of these tokens (60 million) are allocated for the presale, providing early adopters with an opportunity to engage in the project's evolution from the outset. The $PENGU token is intended for in-app use within Penguiana's ecosystem, particularly in an upcoming play-to-earn game.

              "__cdata": "<br># Bitcoin and Coinbase Lead the Way in the Bull Market\n\n## Bitcoin Breaks Out\n\nThis week, broad stock market indexes hit new all-time highs, confirming the current bull market. After a ~6% pullback in the S&P 500 in April, the strong snapback to new highs should encourage investors looking to add risk to their portfolios. Bitcoin, which has been acting as a proxy for risk, is tightly correlated with US equities, especially technology stocks. For every 1% gain in stocks, Bitcoin can jump 3-5%.\n\nOn Wednesday, the price of Bitcoin broke out from a bullish wedge/flag pattern. This breakout marks the third one in the cryptocurrency since October, signaling bullish action.\n\n## Coinbase Global Excels\n\nInvestors looking to ride the Bitcoin trend can also consider investing in Coinbase Global (COIN). As the leading cryptocurrency brokerage in the US, Coinbase offers retail and some institutional investors access to the crypto ecosystem. The company's most recent quarterly earnings crushed expectations, driven by growing trading activity in Bitcoin and other cryptos.\n\nEarnings estimates for Coinbase have soared in the past two months, with FY24 climbing from $1.57 per share to $7.18 per share. This increase has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. The stock is forming a descending wedge pattern and a breakout above the $220 level could signal new highs.\n\n## Cleanspark: The Alternative Bitcoin Play\n\nFor exposure to Bitcoin in the stock market, investors can also consider cryptocurrency miners like Cleanspark (CLSK). While less followed than other miners like Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms Inc. (RIOT), Cleanspark has shown more promise in the near future. Over the past three months, six months, 12 months, and year-to-date, Cleanspark has outperformed its peers and is the only one with positive YTD returns.\n\nEarnings estimates for Cleanspark have been revised significantly higher, giving it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating. The stock is forming a broad bull flag pattern and a breakout above $17.70 could send it higher.\n\n## iShares Bitcoin Trust: Direct Exposure to Bitcoin\n\nFor investors looking for direct exposure to Bitcoin through the stock market, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF is a viable option. While not currently covered by Zacks Rank, IBIT offers low fees compared to other Bitcoin ETFs like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC).\n\nIn conclusion, for those looking to add high-flying stocks to their portfolios and willing to tolerate volatility for returns, Bitcoin and related stocks like Coinbase and Cleanspark present compelling opportunities in the current bull market.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin's Surge in Crypto Market</h2>\n<p>This week, the crypto market witnessed a resurgence, spearheaded by Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the largest token by market cap. The recent weeks were marked by uncertainty surrounding geopolitical events and the Federal Reserve's actions, leading to a cautious market environment. However, the tide turned in favor of risk-taking, propelling Bitcoin to a 10.1% surge over the past seven days as of 2:40 p.m. ET on Friday.</p>\n\n<h3>Impact on Bitcoin-Linked Companies</h3>\n<p>The significant movement in Bitcoin also had a ripple effect on companies heavily leveraged to the cryptocurrency. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), a prominent Bitcoin holder, saw a 33.6% increase before settling for a 28.8% gain. Similarly, mining companies like Marathon Digital (NASDAQ: MARA), Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), and Hut 8 (NASDAQ: HUT) witnessed substantial upticks in their stock prices.</p>\n\n<h2>Bitcoin's Recent Performance</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin had experienced a decline in value post the halving event that reduced mining rewards. Market concerns over the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy and escalating conflicts further dampened Bitcoin's performance. However, the resurgence in risk appetite this week, fueled by certain personalities, breathed life back into various stocks, ultimately spilling over to the crypto market.</p>\n\n<p>The volatile trading dynamics observed this week raised questions on the sustainability of the market rally driven more by speculative trading than fundamental value creation.</p>\n\n<h2>Leveraging Bitcoin for Gains</h2>\n<p>Companies closely tied to Bitcoin, such as MicroStrategy, and Bitcoin mining firms like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, have enjoyed substantial gains as Bitcoin's value surged. These companies stand to benefit not only from the increased value of mined Bitcoin but also from the appreciation of Bitcoin holdings on their balance sheets.</p>\n\n<p>Investing in Bitcoin-linked stocks like MicroStrategy and mining companies presents a delicate balancing act influenced by Bitcoin's price fluctuations.</p>\n\n<h2>Future Outlook for Bitcoin</h2>\n<p>The current market scenario bears resemblance to the crypto market's peak in 2021, characterized by lofty stock valuations and diminishing fundamentals. While Bitcoin is often perceived as a growth asset rather than a hedge against market uncertainty, external economic factors could impact its performance.</p>\n\n<p>The influx of billions into the crypto industry, driven by ETF approvals and renewed trading activities, may not be sustainable in the face of economic headwinds. As a result, maintaining a cautious stance on Bitcoin and related stocks is advisable until clearer market trends emerge.</p>\n<br>"

The collaboration between the two tech giants has already generated a buzz in the market, with Reddit's stock witnessing a remarkable 13% surge in after-hours trading following the official announcement.</p>\n\n<h3>Details of the Partnership</h3>\n\n<p>The partnership, unveiled on May 16, involves Reddit granting OpenAI access to its Data API. This access will allow OpenAI to tap into real-time, structured, and exclusive content sourced from Reddit's platform posts. By integrating social media content into ChatGPT and other upcoming products, this collaboration aims to enhance user exploration and interaction within Reddit communities.</p>\n\n<p>In return, OpenAI will provide Reddit users and moderators with innovative AI-driven features designed to boost user engagement. As Reddit leverages OpenAI's advanced AI models to realize its ambitious vision, OpenAI has also been appointed as Reddit's newest advertising partner, further solidifying their strategic alliance.</p>\n\n<p>Steve Huffman, the Co-Founder and CEO of Reddit, expressed his excitement about the partnership, emphasizing Reddit's position as a valuable archive of authentic and up-to-date human conversations. Huffman highlighted the alignment with ChatGPT's mission, which aims to connect users and communities while providing a seamless browsing experience.</p>\n\n<p>Brad Lightcap, the Chief Operating Officer at OpenAI, underscored the potential for ChatGPT to deliver timely information and enhance the overall Reddit experience with AI-driven features, offering users a more personalized and engaging platform.</p>\n\n<h3>Legal Challenges in the AI Industry</h3>\n\n<p>While this partnership marks a significant milestone for both Reddit and OpenAI, it also comes at a time when AI companies are facing increased scrutiny over their data acquisition practices. Recent reports suggest that Sony Music Group, the world's largest music publisher, has issued warnings to over 700 entities, including prominent AI developers like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, regarding potential unauthorized use of their music for model training.</p>\n\n<p>Despite these legal challenges, Reddit remains committed to leveraging its collaborations with tech giants like OpenAI and Google to enhance its platform's functionality and user experience, while opening up new avenues for innovation and growth in the AI space.</p>\n<br>"

At the current market rate of approximately $62,200 per BTC, this transaction amounts to nearly half a billion dollars. The news made waves on social media as Whale Alert tweeted about the massive transfer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 🚨 7,999 #BTC (494,138,045 USD) transferred from #Coinbase to unknown new wallet</p>\n<p>- Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 15, 2024</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A closer examination of blockchain data reveals a notable pattern in the movement of these funds. Following the initial transfer to a new address identified as \"1JmaF,\" the Bitcoin was subsequently divided into smaller portions and distributed across 62 other addresses. Each of these subsequent transfers involved approximately 165.3 BTC, equivalent to roughly $10.2 million, raising questions about the motives behind the fragmentation of funds and the identity of the parties involved.</p>\n\n<h3>The Timing and Implications</h3>\n\n<p>The timing of this substantial withdrawal is particularly noteworthy, coinciding with heightened anticipation surrounding updates on U.S. consumer inflation. Analysts speculate that the forthcoming release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) could have significant implications for financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector. While expectations suggest that the April CPI may not signal a significant uptick in inflation, uncertainties persist regarding the potential market reaction to the data.</p>\n\n<p>The outcome of the April CPI report holds significant sway over market sentiment. A higher-than-expected CPI could trigger increased market volatility, while a more subdued report might temporarily ease concerns about inflation. The question of the unknown entity's expectations behind this significant Bitcoin withdrawal looms large. Is the whale, as such holders are often referred to in cryptocurrency circles, banking on favorable economic data and subsequent market growth?</p>\n<br>"

The fund's move to invest in the bitcoin fund is in line with its strategy to diversify its portfolio and explore emerging investment opportunities.\n\n### Growing Trend Among Hedge Funds\n\nPoint72 is not the only hedge fund venturing into the world of cryptocurrency. Several other hedge funds have disclosed their allocations into spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This trend includes prominent names like Paul Singer’s Elliott Capital and Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management. In fact, Millennium Management is currently the largest institutional holder of the new funds, with approximately $2 billion invested in them as of March 31.\n\n### Increasing Interest Among Top U.S. Hedge Funds\n\nData compiled by bitcoin brokerage firm River shows that out of the top 25 hedge funds in the United States, 13 of them purchased shares of ETFs in the first quarter. Fortress Investment Group and Schonfeld Strategic Advisors are among the names that joined the likes of Point72 in exploring the potential of these investment vehicles.\n\n### Varied Reasons for Investment\n\nWhile the focus on spot ETFs may be attributed to a long-term bullish outlook on the cryptocurrency market, hedge funds could be investing in these instruments for various reasons. These include market making, hedging against risks, generating yield, or even engaging in short-term trading strategies. The increasing interest from established financial institutions indicates a growing acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class in the traditional investment space.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Pink Drainer Announces Retirement After Stealing Millions\n\n### Scam-as-a-Service Leader, Pink Drainer, to Cease Operations\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, the notorious wallet-draining tool known as Pink Drainer has declared its retirement after causing chaos in the digital asset sector and illicitly siphoning millions of dollars from cryptocurrency wallets. The mastermind behind the scam-as-a-service operation, Pink Drainer, has made a public announcement via Telegram stating the winding down of its nefarious infrastructure.\n\nIn an unexpected move, Pink Drainer revealed that it had achieved its goal, prompting the decision to retire from its illicit activities. The developers of Pink Drainer have emphasized that they have no intentions of returning to their criminal endeavors. They cautioned the public to be wary of any messages claiming to be from them unless they are verified by specific wallet signatures.\n\n### Confirmation from Blockchain Security Company\n\nThe announcement of Pink Drainer's retirement was further corroborated by blockchain security company PeckShield, which highlighted the departure of the fraudulent network. PeckShield also pointed out that Pink Drainer addresses had deposited a substantial amount of up to 18.1 million DAI into the DeFi lending protocol Spark, securing a significant portion of the total sDAI tokens.\n\n### Massive Theft Revelations\n\nShocking revelations by ScamSniffer data exposed the extent of Pink Drainer's criminal activities, disclosing that the scam-as-a-service entity had stolen over $85 million from more than 21,000 victims in the past year alone. This alarming statistic solidified Pink Drainer's position as one of the largest sDAI holders in the crypto space, as reported by PeckShield.\n\nWith Pink Drainer voluntarily announcing its retirement and the eventual dismantling of its infrastructure, the crypto community remains vigilant against similar threats of malicious actors looking to exploit vulnerabilities in the digital asset sector. The swift action taken by authorities and blockchain security firms serves as a reminder of the ongoing efforts to combat fraudulent schemes and protect investors from falling victim to such scams.\n<br>"

While much of the focus has been on the gaming sector, industry experts believe it's time for blockchain to address more pressing issues. Jaymes Nicholas Shrimski, chief of staff at AHG Lab, a venture studio based in Metro Manila, is one such advocate for blockchain's potential to tackle real-world challenges.\n\n<h3>Supporting Startups</h3>\nAHG Lab is known for more than just providing financial support to startups. The company offers a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to help budding entrepreneurs succeed, spanning operations, finances, and marketing. Despite their track record, AHG Lab has yet to invest in a blockchain startup, citing a lack of exposure to the sector.\n\n<h3>Embracing Innovation</h3>\nShrimski recently attended the Block Dojo Investors Night, where he came across three promising startups from the inaugural Block Dojo Philippines cohort. Of the three, RealFlip caught his attention the most. Founded by Jaimee Ligan, RealFlip leverages blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent real estate ownership platform, complete with an escrow system that guarantees efficiency and reliability.\n\n<h3>Unlocking Potential</h3>\nShrimski is confident in the Philippines' capacity to become a leader in blockchain and other emerging technologies. With a rapidly growing digital economy and a tech-savvy population, the country presents a fertile ground for blockchain adoption. Smartphone penetration stands at 80%, poised to reach 97% in the coming years, signaling a strong market for blockchain-powered solutions.\n\n<h3>Expanding Horizons</h3>\nWhile blockchain has gained traction in the gaming industry, Shrimski believes its true potential lies in addressing critical sectors such as land title verification, digital identity, and financial inclusion. By shifting the focus from entertainment to essential services, blockchain can make a tangible impact on society, transforming the Philippines into a global powerhouse of blockchain innovation.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## U.S. Senate Votes to Repeal SEC Accounting Rule for Crypto Custodians\n\nThe U.S. Senate recently made a significant decision by voting to repeal a controversial U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting rule that imposed burdensome capital requirements on crypto custodians. This rule, known as the Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121, had been a point of contention between the crypto and banking industries.\n\n### President Biden Expected to Veto Repeal\n\nDespite the Senate's vote, the measure is now on its way to President Joseph Biden's desk. President Biden has expressed his intention to veto the repeal in alignment with the SEC's stance on the matter. Despite several high-profile Democrats, like New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, supporting the repeal, the Senate fell short of the threshold needed to override a presidential veto.\n\n### Speculation on the Implications of the Vote\n\nThe outcome of the Senate's vote has sparked speculation about potential realignments among legislators in favor of more favorable crypto regulations. The Government Accountability Office found that the SEC pushed through SAB 121 without proper congressional oversight, adding to the arguments in favor of its repeal.\n\n### Mixed Opinions on the Future of Crypto Legislation\n\nWhile some senators supported the repeal to address the challenges posed by crypto accounting rules, others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, voted to maintain the rule citing concerns about the potential financial impact of crypto-related risks on companies. The bipartisan support for overturning SAB 121 raises questions about future legislative efforts related to stablecoins and market structure.\n\n### Industry Reaction and Concerns\n\nThe crypto industry's response to the Senate's vote has been divided. While some experts see the bipartisan support as a positive sign for the industry, others remain skeptical about the uncertain regulatory landscape. The impact of SAB 121 on financial institutions' ability to venture into crypto custody has already been noted in the industry.\n\nIn conclusion, the Senate's decision to vote on the repeal of SAB 121 has brought attention to the challenges and uncertainties surrounding crypto regulations. The discussions around this issue highlight the need for clear and comprehensive regulatory frameworks to support the growth and innovation of the crypto industry.\n<br>"

Atlantis, a project dedicated to addressing climate change problems, particularly related to water, has taken on the challenge of redistributing water from areas of surplus to areas of need using blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>At a recent Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, Irthu Suresh, CEO of Atlantis, shared insights into the project's success in Chikmagalur, India. Through a Web3 solution, Atlantis implemented a system of \"bounties\" in 50 villages to incentivize people to transfer water effectively from areas with more water to those with less. The pilot program was highly successful, exchanging over 21,000 kiloliters of water.</p>\n\n<h3>Adopting Blockchain for a Greater Cause</h3>\n<p>Initially starting as a Web2 company, Atlantis faced challenges in its mission to combat climate change and water issues. Private entities were finding it difficult to make a significant impact, mainly due to regulatory obstacles and power structures. This led Atlantis to explore decentralized systems, ultimately incorporating blockchain technology into their project to ensure sustainability and resilience.</p>\n\n<h3>The Impact of Blockchain in Water Distribution</h3>\n<p>Using a mobile native app, Atlantis engaged local communities in various tasks related to water harvesting and distribution. Through gamified \"bounties,\" individuals could contribute to building a peer-to-peer water network, creating additional pools of surplus resources. Blockchain technology was crucial in ensuring the transparency and security of the distributed ledger system that facilitated these transactions.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Atlantis has successfully exchanged over 21,000 kiloliters of water, involving over 3,000 individuals across 50 villages. The project has created local green jobs and empowered communities to manage their water resources effectively.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenges and Future Prospects</h3>\n<p>Throughout the project, Atlantis encountered obstacles such as regulatory hurdles and user education on blockchain technology. However, the team remains focused on expanding their impact and providing solutions to combat water scarcity and poverty globally.</p>\n<p>By promoting the interoperability of various blockchain networks, Atlantis aims to address climate change issues irrespective of the platform or token used for funding. Their ultimate goal is to showcase the potential of blockchain technology beyond trading, emphasizing its ability to drive positive change in the world.</p>\n\n<h3>Looking Ahead</h3>\n<p>As Atlantis prepares to participate in the upcoming Consensus event, they are eager to share their experiences and insights with the global blockchain community. By leveraging blockchain for social good, Atlantis hopes to inspire others to explore innovative solutions for pressing environmental challenges and create a more sustainable future for all.</p>\n<br>"

This decision paves the way for Genesis to return customer assets that have been frozen on the platform since November 2022 when the firm paused withdrawals following the collapse of other major crypto firms.\n\n## Legal Challenge Rejected\n\nJudge Lane rejected DCG's legal challenge, stating that Genesis' parent company lacked legal standing to challenge the Chapter 11 plan. As Genesis's equity holder, DCG is last in line for repayment in Chapter 11 proceedings. Judge Lane highlighted that the value of the bankrupt subsidiary for distribution is being absorbed by creditors, who are ahead of DCG.\n\n## Dispute Over Creditor Claims\n\nDCG argued that the plan would provide Genesis creditors with an unjust benefit at its expense. The parent company insisted that creditor claims should be based on crypto prices at the time of Genesis's bankruptcy filing in 2023 when Bitcoin was trading around $24,000, compared to the current price of over $66,700.\n\n## Potential Appeal\n\nWhile DCG could appeal Judge Lane's decision, Genesis estimates that creditors who lent digital assets may recover up to 77% under its proposal. This proposal garnered significant support from creditors, including customers of Gemini Earn, a lending program operated jointly with Gemini Trust Co.\n\n## Further Approvals\n\nIn addition to approving the repayment plan, Judge Lane also greenlit a settlement with New York Attorney General Letitia James over the Earn program. This settlement ensures that assets that could have gone to state authorities will be returned to former Earn customers instead. \n\nThe case, Genesis Global Holdco, LLC, 23-10063, was heard in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). This update provides context for the recent ruling in the ongoing legal battle.\n<br>"

Despite this, the cryptocurrency is on the verge of breaking above the moving average once again. With the $6 support level holding firm multiple times, there is a higher probability of a bullish breakout rather than a bearish continuation. This could potentially lead to a climb above the 200-day moving average towards $9 in the short term.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_332398\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-332398\" style=\"width: 2560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DOTUSDT-Daily-May-17-2024-scaled.jpg\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"><img class=\"wp-image-332398 size-full\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNTYwIDEzMDkiIHdpZHRoPSIyNTYwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEzMDkiIGRhdGEtdT0iaHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZjcnlwdG9wb3RhdG8uY29tJTJGd3AtY29udGVudCUyRnVwbG9hZHMlMkYyMDI0JTJGMDUlMkZET1RVU0RULURhaWx5LU1heS0xNy0yMDI0LXNjYWxlZC5qcGciIGRhdGEtdz0iMjU2MCIgZGF0YS1oPSIxMzA5IiBkYXRhLWJpcD0iIj48L3N2Zz4=\" data-spai=\"1\" alt=\"dot_price_chart_1705241\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1309\"/></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-332398\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>\n\n<h3><b>The 4-Hour Chart</b></h3>\n<p>Looking at the 4-hour timeframe, the market is seeing a gradual rise within a large ascending channel.

The decision leaves its owner, Digital Currency Group (DCG), with no recovery from the bankruptcy.\n\nU.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane approved Genesis' Chapter 11 liquidation plan and dismissed an objection raised by DCG. The objection was based on the argument that Genesis should only pay its customers and creditors the value of the crypto assets at the time of Genesis's bankruptcy filing in January 2023.\n\n<h3>Rise in Crypto Prices</h3>\nThe disagreement between DCG and Genesis arose due to the substantial increase in crypto prices since Genesis filed for bankruptcy. Bitcoin, for example, was valued at $21,084 in January 2023, compared to its current price of $67,000.\n\nJudge Lane ruled against DCG's objection, stating that even if customer claims were restricted to the lower prices, Genesis would have to pay numerous other creditors, including federal and state financial regulators with claims totaling $32 billion, before allocating funds to DCG.\n\n<h3>Customer Repayment</h3>\nGenesis is in the process of repaying customers in cryptocurrency where possible. However, the company does not possess sufficient cryptocurrency to fulfill all its obligations.\n\nGenesis attorney Sean O'Neal expressed disagreement with DCG's claim that customers could be paid in full based on the lower cryptocurrency prices in January 2023. O'Neal stated, \"We don't agree that claims are capped at the petition date value.\"\n\nGenesis anticipated in February that it would be able to repay customers up to 77% of the value of their claims, subject to future price fluctuations. DCG was unavailable for comment at the time of reporting.\n\nThis significant decision highlights the complexities of bankruptcy proceedings in the cryptocurrency industry and the challenges faced by companies and investors in such situations.\n<br>"

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, as reported by Alternative.me, has surged to a high of 74, indicating a shift in sentiment among digital asset investors.</p>\n\n<h3>Market Turmoil Leads to Neutral Sentiment</h3>\n<p>Earlier this month, the Fear and Greed Index stood at 54, signaling neutral sentiment for the first time since January. During this period, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading in a range between $57,000 and $60,000, and the broader crypto market experienced heightened volatility and a significant decline in total market capitalization.</p>\n\n<p>Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop below crucial support levels, leading to an 11% decline within 36 hours. This plunge wiped out over $200 billion from the crypto market, impacting altcoins, meme coins, and digital asset investment funds.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin Surges to Three-Week High</h3>\n<p>Despite the recent turmoil, Bitcoin's price has seen a resurgence, climbing to a three-week high of over $66,000. The leading cryptocurrency rallied from $61,000 over the weekend to $64,000 on Wednesday, and it is currently trading at $66,200, reflecting a 5% increase over the past seven days.</p>\n\n<p>The surge in Bitcoin's price has also translated to significant inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Wednesday, ETF inflows reached $303 million, the highest level since May 3. This trend continued with an additional $257 million in inflows reported yesterday.</p>\n\n<h2>Implications of Greed in the Market</h2>\n<p>With the Fear and Greed Index now indicating greed among investors, there is a possibility of a further market rally pushing it into the extreme greed zone.

This collaboration aims to provide users with a seamless experience in purchasing cryptocurrencies using various payment methods.</h3>\n\n<p>Meteor Wallet, known for its support for multiple blockchains, digital tokens, and decentralized finance (defi) applications, now offers a new feature that allows users to buy cryptocurrencies using credit and debit cards or Apple Pay. This integration not only simplifies the purchasing process but also provides easy access to the NEAR protocol, a prominent layer-one blockchain known for its operation as a community-run cloud computing platform.</p>\n\n<p>Meteor Wallet serves as an interface for managing digital tokens and accessing defi services and decentralized applications (dApps) on the NEAR blockchain. By incorporating Mercuryo's on-ramp solutions, the wallet aims to enhance the user experience and facilitate effortless transactions in the crypto space.</p>\n\n<h3>Excitement Among NEAR Community</h3>\n\n<p>The news of the integration was met with enthusiasm within the NEAR community.

              "__cdata": "<br>## Future of Finance Event in New York Highlights Impact of Cryptocurrency\n\n### Executives Stepping into the Mainstream\n\nHappy Friday! Yesterday, I attended the Future of Finance event in New York, hosted by Fortune. The event brought together prominent figures from traditional finance giants like BlackRock and Apollo, alongside newer players such as PayPal and Robinhood. The highlight of the day was the crypto panel featuring industry leaders from Coinbase, Grayscale, and Ripple.\n\nDuring the panel discussion, it was evident that the executives from these crypto companies were seamlessly integrated into the finance industry, signaling a departure from the fringe status they held in previous years.\n\n### Crypto Visionaries Andrew Yang and Anthony Scaramucci Take Center Stage\n\nThe most memorable moment of the event was the dinner keynote featuring Andrew Yang and Anthony \"the Mooch\" Scaramucci. Both individuals have had significant roles in U.S. politics, with Yang being a presidential candidate in the 2020 Democratic primary and Scaramucci serving as Donald Trump's communications director.\n\nYang shared his innovative idea of incorporating blockchain technology into a time-bank system that compensates Americans for various unpaid tasks like childcare. He emphasized the importance of such a system in the face of advancing AI technology that threatens to replace millions of jobs.\n\nOn the other hand, Scaramucci, a crypto investor through his hedge fund, made a political case for blockchain adoption. He highlighted the growing number of Americans who own crypto assets and criticized President Joe Biden and Democratic leaders for their anti-crypto stance.\n\n### Shift in Democratic Party's Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nThe comments made by Yang and Scaramucci come at a time when a growing number of Democrats are reevaluating their position on cryptocurrency. Recently, 11 senators from the party sided with Republicans to pass a bill overturning SEC accounting guidelines that hinder banks from holding crypto assets. This move signals a changing tide within the party, with even Majority Leader Charles Schumer and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand supporting the bill.\n\nDespite Biden's intention to veto the bill, the shift in attitudes towards cryptocurrency suggests that he may reconsider his stance. It appears that crypto has reached a tipping point in the U.S., making attempts to suppress it futile.\n\nAs the landscape evolves, elected officials are urged to adapt to the changing times. The narrative around cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, and those who fail to acknowledge its significance may find themselves left behind.\n\nBy Jeff John Roberts, [email protected], @jeffjohnroberts\n<br>"

Bawumia believes that this move will not only ensure the security of government data and records but will also set Ghana on a path to becoming a \"blockchain-powered government.\"\n\n<h3>Fighting Corruption with Blockchain</h3>\nDuring the 14th Commonwealth Regional Conference, Bawumia highlighted blockchain as a powerful tool for combating corruption in the public sector. He expressed his hope that all government agencies will be fully digitalized by the end of the year to facilitate the smooth implementation of this new phase.\n\nBawumia drew inspiration from countries like Estonia, envisioning Ghana integrating its databases through the X-Road Integration Infrastructure. By applying blockchain technology across all government operations, Bawumia believes that the country can swiftly and securely identify any alterations in digital data and connected devices.\n\n<h3>Setting a Global Example</h3>\nBeyond ensuring data immutability, Bawumia sees blockchain as a key strategy in the fight against corruption. He revealed his administration's ambitious goal of making Ghana one of the world's few blockchain-powered governments and the first on the African continent. Emulating the success of countries like Estonia, Ghana aims to leverage blockchain technology to enhance governance and transparency.\n\nBy embracing blockchain, the Ghanaian government seeks to enhance its digital infrastructure, safeguard sensitive information, and streamline administrative processes. With this bold step towards blockchain adoption, Ghana is poised to join the ranks of global leaders in digital innovation.\n<br>"

This news highlights a significant move by the banking giant into the world of cryptocurrency.\n\n<h3>Other Banking Giants Follow Suit</h3>\nJoining Morgan Stanley in this trend are other prominent banking giants such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and UBS. These institutions have also disclosed holdings in the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds during the first quarter of the year, indicating a growing interest in digital assets among traditional financial institutions.\n\n<h3>Understanding the Implications</h3>\nIt is important to note that these investments do not necessarily reflect the banks' opinions on the future direction of bitcoin's price. Instead, these moves are likely made on behalf of the banks' wealth management clients or to fulfill market-making and ETF authorized participant obligations.\n\nFurthermore, Morgan Stanley recently made headlines by allowing spot bitcoin ETF allocations to its clients shortly after their approval in January. However, this service is only available on an unsolicited basis, meaning that clients must propose the investment to their brokers.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent investments by Morgan Stanley and other banking giants in the Bitcoin Trust signal a significant shift in the traditional financial sector towards cryptocurrencies. The growing interest in digital assets among institutional investors could have far-reaching implications for the future of the market.\n<br>"

This launch marks a significant milestone in automating compliance for protocol developers, allowing them to focus on impactful projects rather than navigating complex regulations.\n\n### Easing Compliance Burden for Developers\n\nInstitutions seeking to engage with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols must ensure that their transactions meet compliance standards.

With the introduction of DeFi Sentinel on Sui, developers can seamlessly integrate compliance tools to meet institutional and regulatory requirements.\n\n### Advanced Compliance Solutions\n\nDeFi Sentinel leverages Netki's cutting-edge technology to provide real-time Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, wallet screening, financial transaction monitoring, securities compliance, and tax compliance. By combining on-chain and off-chain data, the solution ensures adherence to institutional risk and regulatory standards for each transaction.\n\n### Enhancing User Onboarding\n\nSui will also integrate Netki's OnboardID to streamline user onboarding and identity verification processes. This integration reduces costs and simplifies compliance for Sui developers, making decentralized financial systems more accessible globally. According to Evan Cheng, CEO of Mysten Labs, Netki's integration reinforces security and compliance on Sui, instilling confidence in developers and participants.\n\n### Transaction-by-Transaction Compliance\n\nNetki's DeFi Compliance Oracle offers transaction-by-transaction compliance, a critical feature for institutional acceptance of DeFi tools. With real-time name and wallet screening, the solution seamlessly integrates compliance and risk management into transaction flows without compromising user experience or developer agility.\n\n### Setting New Standards for DeFi Safety\n\nJustin Newton, CEO of Netki, emphasizes the partnership with Sui's robust blockchain infrastructure to establish new safety and compliance standards in the DeFi space. The goal is to facilitate the adoption of DeFi technologies safely and efficiently, enabling developers to innovate while meeting evolving compliance requirements effortlessly. By combining advanced technology with regulatory compliance, Netki is contributing to the growth and acceptance of decentralized finance globally.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## peaq and Fetch.ai Announce Partnership for Multi-Chain Self-Sovereign Machine Identities\n\n### Introduction to the Collaboration\npeaq, a Web3 network specializing in the Economy of Things, has joined forces with Fetch.ai, an innovative platform that combines automation and AI capabilities. The aim of this partnership is to introduce multi-chain Self-Sovereign Machine Identities that will enable data exchange and identification among vehicles, robots, and devices within the Polkadot and Cosmos ecosystems.\n\n### Addressing Interoperability Challenges in Web3\nThe collaboration between peaq and Fetch.ai aims to tackle the challenge of limited interoperability within the Web3 space. Standalone blockchains often present obstacles to seamless connectivity. However, projects like Polkadot and Cosmos have emerged as leaders in native interoperability efforts, striving to create a more connected and open Web3 environment.\n\n### Enhancing Multi-Chain Interoperability\nBy introducing multi-chain Machine IDs on peaq, the collaboration takes interoperability efforts to the next level. These Machine IDs enable decentralized data exchanges between the Polkadot and Cosmos ecosystems, bridging the gap between the two multi-chain environments.\n\n### Functionality of Multi-Chain Machine IDs\nThis functionality is made possible through a decentralized address book integrated into peaq's storage pallet. Users can create a Machine ID on peaq and choose to add their address to this address book. An autonomous agent is then generated on Fetch.ai's Agentverse, and its address and wallet in the Cosmos IBC ecosystem are added to the address map on peaq, along with the machine's peaq ID. This enables multi-chain data exchanges among vehicles, robots, and devices on both ecosystems.\n\n### Future Opportunities and Use Cases\nThe introduction of multi-chain Machine IDs aligns with peaq's vision of a multi-chain Economy of Things. It opens up possibilities for decentralized energy grids, shared autonomous vehicles, supply chain management, healthcare systems, and more. The new innovation also paves the way for multi-chain crowdfunding of fleets of connected vehicles, robots, and devices through peaq's Machine DeFi suite.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe collaboration between peaq and Fetch.ai signals a significant step towards a multi-chain future for the Economy of Things and Web3. By offering limitless opportunities for developers in both ecosystems, the integration of peaq IDs and Fetch.ai's Autonomous Agents aims to create a fragmented-immune Economy of Things.

The bill, known as FIT21, is poised for a floor vote next week and the industry believes its passage is crucial for the U.S. to remain competitive in the global market.\n\n## Coalition Advocates for Regulation\n\nThe Crypto Council for Innovation, which includes major players like Coinbase, Kraken, and Andreessen Horowitz, along with about 50 others, have come together to write a letter to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. They are advocating for the passage of FIT21, which designates the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the leading regulator of digital assets. The bill aims to establish clear guidelines for regulatory oversight, consumer protections, and measures to prevent risky behavior.\n\n## Accelerating Blockchain Technology \n\nThe industry believes that passing this legislation will not only accelerate the growth of blockchain technology and digital assets, but also promote financial inclusion and protect national security. Maintaining leadership in financial innovation is crucial for the U.S. to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving crypto market.\n\n## Industry's Recent Wins\n\nThe crypto industry has recently celebrated a victory in Washington with both the House and Senate easily passing a resolution that overturned a crypto accounting policy by the SEC. However, President Joe Biden has vowed to veto this effort. The industry's success in overturning the SEC's policy has drawn support from both Democrats and Republicans, with key figures like Majority Leader Chuck Schumer backing the industry's cause.\n\n## Senate's Response \n\nWhile the House is moving forward with FIT21, key Senate Democrats have not shown the same level of readiness to support the bill. Senate Democrats have only hinted at including a different crypto bill, focused on regulating stablecoin issuers, in a package deal with other financial legislation. The level of Democratic support for FIT21 in the House could be a deciding factor in influencing the Senate's stance on the bill.\n\n## The Road Ahead\n\nAs FIT21 approaches a House vote, industry insiders are closely watching for any amendments proposed by the House Rules Committee. The Senate's response to the bill may hinge on the level of support it garners from the House, particularly from Democratic lawmakers who hold significant sway in the decision-making process.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>New Binance Listings Facing Decline in Value</h2>\n<p>Recent data shows that over 80% of newly listed cryptocurrencies on Binance, the world's leading digital asset exchange, have experienced a decline in value. Within the last six months, these tokens have seen a significant drop in their market value post-listing, causing concerns among investors looking for promising assets.</p>\n\n<h3>Analysis of New Token Performance</h3>\n<p>A report published on May 17 by a pseudonymous crypto researcher known as Flow revealed that out of 31 tokens analyzed, only five have shown a positive trend in value. These tokens include Meme Coin (MEME), Ordi Token (ORDI), Jupiter (JUP) based on Solana blockchain, Jito (JTO), and Dogwifhat (WIF).</p>\n\n<p>Despite lacking support from venture capitalists, the Ordi token has emerged as the most profitable among the newly listed tokens, with a remarkable increase of over 261% since its debut. Following closely behind is the controversial meme coin Dogwifhat, which surged by more than 117% in value.</p>\n\n<h3>Challenges Faced by New Listings</h3>\n<p>Flow highlighted a concerning trend where top-tier venture capitalists tend to back most new Binance listings, leading to inflated valuations at launch. The average fully diluted valuation (FDV) of tokens on their listing date exceeds $4.2 billion, with some tokens reaching as high as $11 billion. Despite these valuations, many of these projects lack a solid user base or community support.</p>\n\n<p>The researcher pointed out that if investors had evenly distributed their investments across all new Binance listings in the past six months, their portfolio would have decreased by more than 18%. This indicates that a significant number of tokens listed on Binance may not offer promising investment opportunities and instead serve as exit strategies for insiders, capitalizing on retail investors' limited access to early-stage investments.</p>\n\n<h2>Negative Impact of Token Launches on Market</h2>\n<p>Flow expressed concerns about the current token launch practices, stating that they are detrimental to the overall crypto market. Releasing tokens at high FDVs leads to value erosion and minimal market interest, ultimately resulting in a sharp decline in token value. This approach not only harms the token itself but also tarnishes the reputation of the entire cryptocurrency industry.</p>\n\n<p>He emphasized the need for a new strategy for token launches, pointing to suggestions by other industry experts who believe that launching tokens at lower FDVs could help generate interest and momentum in the market, benefiting both traders and investors.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Taiwan Mobile Explores Partnerships with Local Crypto Platforms</h2>\n\n<h3>Early Negotiations with State-Licensed Telecommunications Company</h3>\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Taiwan's second-largest telecommunications company, Taiwan Mobile, is actively exploring partnerships with local cryptocurrency platforms. The state-licensed provider is currently in the early stages of negotiations with various crypto companies to potentially form alliances in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.\n\nTaiwan Mobile has remained tight-lipped about the specifics of these discussions but has expressed openness to exploring any potential opportunities that could arise from such partnerships. On the other hand, Wayne Huang, co-founder of XREX, one of the leading crypto platforms in Taiwan, neither confirmed nor denied being in talks with the telecommunications giant. However, he anticipates that as the Web3 sector continues to mature and regulatory frameworks become more defined, collaborations with larger organizations like Taiwan Mobile could become more common in the industry.\n\n<h3>Regulatory Developments in Taiwan's Crypto Landscape</h3>\nIn a move to regulate the burgeoning crypto market, Taiwan selected the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) as the primary regulatory authority overseeing virtual asset service providers earlier this year. The FSC is expected to release detailed regulatory guidelines for the sector by the end of September, aiming to establish a clear framework for companies operating in the digital asset space within the country.\n\nNotably, the FSC has clarified that it will not be regulating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at this time, citing the asset class's early stage of development and the need for further industry understanding before imposing regulatory controls. This decision reflects Taiwan's cautious approach to emerging digital assets and a commitment to fostering innovation while ensuring investor protection in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nWith Taiwan Mobile's potential foray into the crypto space and the evolving regulatory landscape, the country's digital asset ecosystem is poised for significant growth and transformation in the coming months. Investors and industry stakeholders are closely monitoring these developments as Taiwan positions itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency market.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Canadian \"Crypto King\" Arrested for Fraud\n\n## Toronto Crypto King Faces Fraud Charges\n\nIn a shocking turn of events, a self-proclaimed Canadian \"Crypto King\" and his associate have been arrested and charged with fraud after allegedly receiving over C$40 million from investors. Aiden Pleterski, 25, and Colin Murphy, 27, found themselves in hot water after a 16-month investigation by Durham Regional Police.\n\n## Fake Profits and Luxury Lifestyle\n\nThe investigation was sparked by numerous complaints of investment fraud beginning in July 2022. Pleterski and Murphy were reportedly \"generating large weekly profits through savvy investments,\" according to a statement from the police. However, it was later discovered that the victims were left \"defrauded\" and unable to recover their funds.\n\nPleterski, who has a social media following of over 100,000, often flaunted his extravagant lifestyle on platforms like TikTok. Posts showcasing his travels and luxury cars such as Lamborghinis and McLarens garnered attention, but it seems the source of his wealth was not as legitimate as it appeared.\n\n## Legal Troubles and Investor Losses\n\nCourt records show that Pleterski received C$41.5 million in investment funds, but only a fraction of that money was actually invested. In August 2022, Ontario's Superior Court declared Pleterski and his company, AP Private Equity Ltd, bankrupt and appointed Grant Thornton Ltd as trustee.\n\nPleterski was released on a bail of C$100,000, with his parents acting as sureties. As part of his bail conditions, he was required to surrender his passport to the Durham police. While he has previously been represented by lawyer Michael Simaan, there has been no comment from him regarding the case.\n\n## Upholding the Law\n\nThe charges against Pleterski and Murphy serve as a warning to those who engage in fraudulent activities within the cryptocurrency industry. As the digital market continues to attract investors, it is essential for authorities to crack down on illegal practices to protect innocent individuals from falling victim to scams.\n\nIn the world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye, it is crucial for investors to exercise caution and due diligence before entrusting their funds to individuals claiming to be “Crypto Kings.”\n<br>"

The plan, although not yet finalized, aims to provide immediate exchange of BTC for fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies at current market prices.\n\n<h3>Market Impact and Competition</h3>\nIf the plan goes through, CME will offer Wall Street investors another option for accessing digital assets, adding to the 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds approved in the US earlier this year. This move signals potential competition for Binance, currently dominating the spot market, as CME Group already leads in Bitcoin futures trading and holds the top position in terms of open interest.\n\n<h3>Background and Previous Ventures</h3>\nCME Group has been a significant player in the digital asset market for years. The company launched Bitcoin futures in December 2017 and introduced micro-Bitcoin futures in May 2021 to meet the demand for smaller-sized contracts. In August 2022, CME announced the rollout of euro-denominated Bitcoin and Ether futures, cash-settled using the euro reference rate.\n\n<h3>Regulatory Context</h3>\nThis move by CME Group follows the approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for direct investment in Bitcoin stock funds earlier this year. The introduction of spot Bitcoin trading would enable traders to benefit from basis trades, exploiting the price difference between futures and spot prices.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential introduction of spot Bitcoin trading by CME Group signifies a significant development in the digital asset market, providing more opportunities for Wall Street investors to access cryptocurrencies. This move could lead to increased competition with platforms like Binance and further solidify CME's position as a key player in the cryptocurrency trading space.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Bipartisan Vote on Crypto Legislation Expected Next Week\n\n## The House's Efforts in Digital Assets Legislation\n\nIn the coming days, the U.S. House of Representatives is gearing up for a pivotal vote on the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, also known as FIT21. This legislation, spearheaded by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), aims to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and set a precedent for future regulatory measures in the field.\n\nMcHenry, who is set to retire at the end of the year, has made digital assets legislation a top priority in his final months in Congress. Under his leadership, the House has seen significant advancements in cryptocurrency regulation, including the passage of several bills through the House Financial Services Committee and efforts to challenge Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) policies on crypto accounting.\n\nFIT21, if approved by a bipartisan vote in the House, will mark a milestone in U.S. crypto regulation. According to McHenry, the outcome of this vote will heavily influence the Senate's stance on cryptocurrency legislation and determine the industry's future regulatory landscape.\n\n## Optimism Surrounding House's Vote on FIT21\n\nAt the recent DC Blockchain Summit, both McHenry and Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.) expressed optimism about the forthcoming House vote on FIT21. Hill, who leads a crypto subcommittee and is a potential successor to McHenry, highlighted the significance of garnering bipartisan support for crypto legislation and emphasized the importance of shaping the industry's future through regulatory measures.\n\nDespite potential challenges in the Senate, with McHenry acknowledging the bill's uncertain prospects, both lawmakers remain hopeful that FIT21 will pave the way for comprehensive crypto regulation in the United States. The strong support from Democrats in the House, particularly in challenging the SEC's crypto accounting provision, indicates a growing consensus on the need for regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nAs the House prepares for this critical vote, all eyes are on the outcome and the potential implications it may have for the broader cryptocurrency industry. With bipartisan cooperation on the horizon, the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. hangs in the balance, awaiting the results of this pivotal legislative moment.\n<br>"

Brown expressed his concerns during a hearing at the Senate Banking Committee, where he highlighted the benefits that blockchain can bring to various industries.\n\nDuring his testimony, Brown emphasized that blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses operate, by increasing transparency, security, and efficiency. He cited examples of how blockchain has already been successfully implemented in supply chain management, healthcare, and finance, leading to cost savings and improved data integrity.\n\nThe CEO also addressed common misconceptions about blockchain, such as its association with cryptocurrency and illegal activities. Brown clarified that while blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, its applications extend far beyond digital currencies. He stressed that blockchain can be used to create secure digital identities, streamline voting processes, and enhance cybersecurity measures.\n\nDespite the numerous benefits of blockchain technology, Brown expressed concerns that unfounded fears and misconceptions are hindering its widespread adoption. He warned that if businesses and governments continue to fear blockchain, they risk falling behind competitors who are already leveraging the technology to gain a competitive edge.\n\nBrown called for increased education and awareness about blockchain to dispel myths and encourage its adoption. He urged policymakers to create a supportive regulatory environment that fosters innovation and allows businesses to explore the full potential of blockchain technology.\n\nIn conclusion, Brown stressed the importance of embracing blockchain and harnessing its transformative power for the benefit of society. He called on stakeholders to overcome their fears and embrace the opportunities that blockchain presents for driving positive change and innovation in various sectors.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Oklahoma Governor Signs ‘Bitcoin Rights’ Bill into Law\n\n### Protecting Oklahomans’ Rights\n\nOklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt has signed a groundbreaking ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill, HB3594, into law, solidifying Oklahomans' legal right to mine, transact with, and self-custody cryptocurrencies. The bill, introduced by Republican state Rep. Brian Hill and carried in the Senate by Republican state Sen. Bill Coleman, was inspired by model policy from the state-focused bitcoin mining advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund.\n\n### Crypto Advocates Celebrate\n\nStitt's signature on the bill is a win for crypto advocates amidst regulatory uncertainties at the federal level. The bill preempts potential federal bans on self-custody by enshrining the right to self-custody crypto and use it for transactions. It also prohibits imposing extra tax based solely on the use of digital assets for payment.\n\n### Mining Crypto Legalized\n\nIn addition to protecting self-custody rights, the bill also legalizes crypto mining for Oklahoma residents, both on a small scale and industrially, as long as they adhere to local noise ordinances. This move positions Oklahoma as a favorable destination for crypto mining companies, as demonstrated by Polaris Technologies' recent $100 million investment in a 200-megawatt mining facility outside Tulsa.\n\n### Preempting Future Bans\n\nBy safeguarding the right to mine within the state, the bill safeguards against potential future bans on crypto mining, such as those seen in states like New York and North Carolina. It also exempts individuals mining crypto or operating nodes from needing a money transmitter license and shields them from liability related to specific transactions they validate.\n\n### Effective Date\n\nThe ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill is set to take effect on November 1, 2024. Oklahoma's proactive approach to protecting crypto rights and promoting mining activities sets a positive precedent for other states and showcases the state's commitment to fostering a welcoming environment for crypto companies and investors.\n<br>"

This collaboration aims to leverage Xalts’ expertise to launch PwC’s asset management solution, utilizing blockchain technology-based solutions and no-code workflows to streamline operational processes.\n\n### Embracing Emerging Technologies\n\nPwC's interest in tokenization is part of its broader strategy of embracing emerging technologies to enhance service delivery for its clients. In 2019, the company introduced a blockchain-based auditing tool to facilitate transparent recording of financial transactions for enterprises. Furthermore, PwC is actively incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations through partnerships with tech giants like Microsoft.\n\n### Focus on Hong Kong Amid Ban on Digital Assets in China\n\nIn light of mainland China’s stringent ban on digital assets, PwC China is likely to concentrate its efforts on Hong Kong, a region known for its more favorable stance toward digital assets. While China remains cautious about blockchain applications in finance, PwC sees tremendous potential in tokenization to drive innovation in the financial services industry.\n\n### PwC and Xalts Eye Business Opportunities in Tokenization Space\n\nPeter Brewin, a Partner at PwC China, expressed optimism about the partnership with Xalts, emphasizing the potential for programmable assets to revolutionize payment and finance. The collaboration aligns with PwC’s commitment to exploring novel solutions in the blockchain tokenization space, as the company positions itself to tap into the growing demand for innovative financial services.\n\n### HKMA's Progress with Project Ensemble\n\nPwC’s foray into tokenization coincides with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority’s (HKMA) ongoing pilot project, Project Ensemble, which involves experimenting with wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC). The initiative aims to enhance interbank deposit settlements through tokenized deposits, injecting fresh dynamism into Hong Kong’s finance sector.\n\nIn conclusion, the partnership between PwC China and Xalts underscores the firms' shared vision for driving advancements in tokenization and programmable assets. As PwC expands its technological capabilities, the collaboration with Xalts signals a promising venture into the evolving landscape of blockchain-based solutions.\n<br>"

The surge took the cryptocurrency to approximately $66,000 according to data from CoinGecko. This uptick followed the release of the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported an inflation rate of 3.4%, meeting expectations. The Federal Reserve has been working to reduce annual inflation to 2%, with measures such as interest rate hikes. The potential pivot by the central bank this year is viewed as a bullish factor for Bitcoin and the entire industry, as lower interest rates could lead to increased interest in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<h2>Shiba Inu Sees 9% Increase with Analysts Predicting Further Gains</h2>\n<p>Shiba Inu, a popular meme coin, experienced a 9% price surge within a 24-hour period. Analysts like Ali Martinez and Dami-Defi anticipate more gains for SHIB, with Martinez projecting a 20% surge if the coin breaks a key level and Dami-Defi forecasting a 50% increase based on technical patterns. The overall meme coin sector is expected to flourish in the coming months.</p>\n\n<h2>PEPE Hits All-Time High and Becomes Third-Largest Meme Coin</h2>\n<p>The meme coin PEPE achieved a new all-time high on May 15, reaching a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion. Despite a slight price retracement, PEPE remains the third-largest asset in the meme coin category, trailing behind only WIF. Investors in PEPE have realized significant gains, with all holders standing at paper profits on May 14 according to IntoTheBlock.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Move-based Blockchains Surge in TVL</h2>\n<h3>Compatibility with EVM Key to Growth</h3>\n\nMove-based blockchains are experiencing a surge in total value locked (TVL) this year, with Sui jumping 233% and Aptos also showing significant growth of 210%, as reported by data aggregator DefiLlama. Rushi Manche, co-founder of Movement Labs, believes that compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) could further boost this growth.\n\nSpeaking to Crypto Briefing, Manche highlighted the importance of onboarding developers and new users for new systems. He emphasized that having compatibility for EVM is crucial for expanding growth during the initial years of a project.\n\n<h3>Movement's M2 Addresses Compatibility with EVM</h3>\n\nCurrently, Ethereum's mainnet holds over 67% of all decentralized finance TVL, underscoring the necessity for new blockchains based on different virtual machines to establish compatibility. Movement's M2 is the first layer-2 blockchain based on Move that offers compatibility with EVM applications, aiming to bridge the gap between the two ecosystems. While still in the devnet phase, testnet and mainnet launches are planned for later this year.\n\nMove was originally developed by Meta for their Diem crypto project. However, regulatory pressures led to the shelving of Diem, prompting former Meta employees to form groups that created Aptos and Sui.\n\n<h3>Combining EVM and Move for Enhanced Performance</h3>\n\nManche explained that Movement is striving to merge EVM and Move technologies by drawing parallels with the technology sector. He likened the concept to new tech having backward compatibility with existing systems, using Sony PlayStation consoles as an example where new models can play games from older versions.\n\nAccording to Manche, EVM compatibility serves as a means to onboard legacy software effectively. While acknowledging the importance of EVM for initial code deployment, he emphasized that long-term smart contract usage and performance rely heavily on Move and Rust programming languages.\n\nIn conclusion, the compatibility between EVM and Move plays a pivotal role in the growth and success of move-based blockchains, as new projects seek to integrate established technologies for enhanced functionality and user adoption.\n<br>"

The filing indicated that these investments could potentially benefit the Wisconsin Retirement System.</p>\n\n<h3>Projection on Other States</h3>\n\n<p>On May 15, macroeconomics analyst \"Macro Scope\" suggested that with the accessibility of BTC investments through regulated spot ETFs, other states might also follow suit. The analyst stated that every state was likely considering similar investments, now that Wisconsin had set a precedent.</p>\n\n<p>This prediction comes after New Hampshire House of Representatives member Keith Ammon proposed investigating the allocation of a small percentage of the state's reserves into a Bitcoin ETF. Ammon highlighted the potential returns on Bitcoin investments, emphasizing the benefits of hindsight in leveraging such opportunities for state financial management.</p>\n\n<h3>Interest from Big Banks and Funds</h3>\n\n<p>Wisconsin's move to invest in Bitcoin ETFs has garnered attention from industry publications and experts. Industry observer \"Marty Party\" noted that the State of Wisconsin Investment Board's actions were significant and could trigger a chain reaction in terms of institutional investment in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have also disclosed their investments in spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Millennium Management, one of the world's largest hedge funds, revealing a substantial $2 billion holding in these ETFs. This trend indicates a growing interest and acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial institutions.</p>\n<br>"

According to data aggregator DefiLlama, this surge can be attributed to the newly launched perpetual decentralized exchange (perp DEX) JOJO, which has experienced a nearly 75% growth in trading volume over the past seven days.\n\nMoreover, JOJO has dominated 61% of Base's perpetual trading volume in the last 24 hours, exceeding $95 million. Jotaro Kujo, the co-founder of JOJO, expressed that there are \"quite a lot of real users\" actively trading perpetual contracts on the platform.\n\n<h3>Farming Airdrops and Engaged Users on Base</h3>\n\nKujo pointed out that while there may be individuals farming airdrops on various projects, the majority of Base's activity is genuine trading by engaged users. He emphasized that the team decided to build JOJO on the Base ecosystem due to the platform's engaged user base, substantial TVL, and rapid growth compared to other chains like Arbitrum and Blast.\n\nFurthermore, Kujo highlighted the user-friendly features of Base, especially the seamless integration with Coinbase, which has contributed to creating a loyal user base on the platform. Despite other chains having larger derivatives volumes, Base stands out for its active user base and the support provided by Coinbase's infrastructure.\n\n<h3>Future Plans for JOJO</h3>\n\nCurrently, JOJO is exclusively available on Base, and Kujo revealed that the team has no immediate plans to expand to other blockchains. Instead, they are focusing on enhancing the product and forming strong relationships within the Base ecosystem. Kujo emphasized the importance of concentrating on a narrow user base to ensure the product's usefulness and avoid distractions from deploying on multiple layer-2 blockchains.\n\nIn conclusion, the JOJO team is committed to developing and improving their offering on Base while maintaining a strong connection with the platform's growing user base.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Bitcoin Creating Millionaires: A Look at the Potential\n\n### Bitcoin Millionaires on the Rise\n\nAccording to the latest Crypto Wealth Report from Henley & Partners, there were 40,500 Bitcoin millionaires in the world at the end of last year. This has solidified Bitcoin as the leading cryptocurrency when it comes to creating wealthy individuals. However, with the current price of Bitcoin hovering around $63,000, the task of becoming a millionaire through Bitcoin investment seems more challenging than ever.\n\n### Bitcoin's Upside Potential\n\nThe key to determining if Bitcoin still has the power to make you a millionaire lies in analyzing various Wall Street price predictions for the cryptocurrency. One notable forecast comes from Cathie Wood of Ark Invest, who initially predicted a future price of $1 million for Bitcoin, which she later increased to $1.48 million and then $3.8 million. Wood based her projections on the growth potential of Bitcoin in various use cases, including increased institutional investment in the cryptocurrency.\n\n### Dollar-Cost Averaging into Bitcoin\n\nEarning a million dollars through Bitcoin investment requires strategic planning, especially considering the volatility of the cryptocurrency. One approach is dollar-cost averaging, where investors commit to investing a set amount into Bitcoin at regular intervals until reaching their financial goal. This method helps mitigate risks associated with sudden price fluctuations in the market.\n\n### The Millionaire Mindset\n\nBecoming a Bitcoin millionaire also requires patience and the ability to navigate through price swings and potential losses. It's essential to have a diversified investment portfolio and to be prepared for the possibility of significant drawdowns in Bitcoin value. While Bitcoin still holds the potential to make millionaires, the increased price of the cryptocurrency compared to its early days means that investors may need a more substantial initial investment to reach that milestone.\n\nIn conclusion, the dream of becoming a Bitcoin millionaire is still achievable, but it requires strategic planning, a diversified portfolio, and a strong stomach for market volatility. While Bitcoin has the potential for significant gains, investors must also be prepared for potential losses along the way.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>AI Cryptocurrencies Predicted to Lead the Market</h2>\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been rapidly advancing, with OpenAI introducing a new ChatGPT model that can even read body motion. This technological progression has led to an uptick in AI-related cryptocurrencies, with the niche's total market capitalization surpassing $30 billion. ChatGPT was consulted to predict which of these assets will emerge as the top performer in the current year.</p>\n\n<h3>Bittensor (TAO) and Fetch.ai (FET) Identified as Top Contenders</h3>\n<p>ChatGPT identified Bittensor (TAO) as one of the main contenders for the leading position due to its surging market cap and strong growth potential. TAO currently trades at around $380, representing a 725% spike compared to the figure observed in May 2023. Despite this growth, TAO has retraced significantly from its all-time high of over $720.</p>\n\n<p>Fetch.ai (FET) was also mentioned as a strong contender by the chatbot, being the second-largest AI cryptocurrency with a market cap of around $5.7 billion. The project's advanced technology and broad applicability in industries like supply chain optimization and smart cities make it a promising asset.</p>\n\n<p>Other AI cryptocurrencies like Render (RNDR), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) were also identified as potential top performers in the market. However, investors were cautioned to conduct thorough research on each asset's specific use cases and technological developments before investing.</p>\n\n<h2>Internet Computer (ICP) Faces Uncertain Future</h2>\n<p>Despite its current leadership in the market, Internet Computer (ICP) was not included in ChatGPT's top 5 list of AI cryptocurrencies. The chatbot suggested that ICP's future performance will depend on its ability to integrate AI functionalities effectively and attract developers and companies to its ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>ICP is currently trading at around $12.75, witnessing a 190% price increase over a six-month period. With a market capitalization nearing $6 billion, ICP is ranked as the 22nd biggest cryptocurrency. The chatbot also highlighted that factors like investment levels in the ecosystem and regulatory changes could significantly impact ICP's performance in the market.</p>\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>Bitcoin's Unprecedented Price Surge in Ongoing Bull Market</h2>\n\n<h3>Current Cycle</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin's price performances over the past decade have been characterized by alternating bear and bull cycles. Typically, the BTC halving event signals the beginning of a bull market, while the period leading up to it is bear-dominated. However, the ongoing cycle, which commenced in mid-2023, took a different trajectory.</p>\n\n<p>The initial momentum came from the anticipated approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Following the actual launch of these products in early 2024, Bitcoin soared past its previous all-time high from 2021, reaching a new peak of nearly $74,000. This surge marked a historical milestone as it was the first time a new peak was reached ahead of a halving event.</p>\n\n<p>The legitimacy of Bitcoin as an investment asset was solidified with the introduction of these ETFs by major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Consequently, there was a significant influx of capital into the market, propelling Bitcoin's price to its current range of $60,000 to $70,000.</p>\n\n<p>The speculation around the US Federal Reserve potentially lowering interest rates later in the year has further fueled optimism towards riskier assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<h3>Bitcoin's Future Trajectory</h3>\n<p>The much-anticipated halving event recently took place, reducing the daily production of new BTC to around 450. This scarcity, coupled with increasing accumulation by ETFs, whales, and retail investors, has continued to support Bitcoin's price levels.</p>\n\n<p>While some experts argue that the impact of halvings may diminish over time, market indicators suggest that Bitcoin is currently in the midst of a prolonged bull cycle. CEO of CryptoQuant, Ki Young Ju, has pointed out that Bitcoin's market cap growth is outpacing its realized cap, a trend that historically precedes an eventual market peak within two years.</p>\n\n<p>If this pattern holds true, the ongoing bull cycle could potentially reach its climax by April 2025, leading investors to closely monitor market developments in the coming months.</p>\n<br>"

This puts Solana ahead of Ethereum by 46 times and Polygon by over 5 times. Despite this feat, Solana has only tapped into 1.6% of its maximum theoretical speed of 65,000 TPS, with network congestion posing challenges that upcoming upgrades are expected to address.\n\n<h3>Non-EVM Blockchains Outpace EVMs</h3>\nAmong non-EVM blockchains, Sui stands out with a peak TPS of 854, achieved during the rise in popularity of the on-chain game Sui 8192 in July 2023. Other non-EVM performers include TON at 175 TPS and Near Protocol at 118 TPS, significantly outpacing EVM-based blockchains which average 74 TPS.\n\n<h3>BSC and Polygon Lead EVM Blockchains</h3>\nIn the realm of EVM-based blockchains, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon have showcased notable transaction speeds. BSC hit 378 TPS on December 7, 2023, driven by increased on-chain activity, while Polygon reached 190 TPS on November 16, 2023. Although these platforms have made strides, they still fall behind Solana and Sui in overall transaction speed.\n\n<h3>Rising On-Chain Activity</h3>\nThe report highlights a surge in on-chain activity across leading blockchain platforms, with almost all top blockchains setting new records for real TPS within the past year. This spike in activity can be attributed to the growing interest in meme coins and inscription-driven transactions. As blockchain technology continues to advance, Solana and Sui are at the forefront of pushing transaction speed boundaries.\n\nDespite challenges like network congestion, upgrades on the horizon are expected to further boost TPS capabilities. Meanwhile, EVM-based blockchains are working to catch up, with BSC and Polygon leading the charge among Ethereum scaling solutions. These developments underscore the rapid progression in blockchain transaction speeds, driven by technological innovations and the expanding on-chain activity landscape.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br># Dogecoin vs Ripple: A Battle for Market Cap Dominance\n\n## Elon Musk Gives Dogecoin an Edge\n\nDogecoin's market capitalization currently stands at $19.8 billion, with a trading price of $0.145 per coin. One key advantage for Dogecoin is its association with Elon Musk, who has been a vocal supporter of the meme currency. Ripple, on the other hand, has been embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC, which could soon come to an end. Despite Ripple's potential legal victory, Dogecoin's partnership with Musk gives it a significant edge in terms of credibility and publicity.\n\n## Dogecoin Sees Surge in Large Holder Inflows\n\nOn May 4, Dogecoin experienced a significant increase in large holder inflows, surging by 582%. This bullish momentum was in stark contrast to the movement of Ripple whales shifting their XRP tokens onto exchanges, a bearish sign for the currency. The influx of large holders into Dogecoin indicates growing investor interest and confidence in the asset.\n\n## Tesla Accepts Dogecoin for Payments\n\nTesla recently began accepting Dogecoin as a form of payment for its cars and trucks, marking a major milestone for the meme currency. This move led to a 21% surge in Dogecoin's price, showcasing the impact of corporate partnerships on cryptocurrency values. While Ripple boasts partnerships with major banks and governments, the instant boost seen by Dogecoin from Tesla's support could give it an edge in the market.\n\n## Dogecoin's Meme Power Prevails\n\nThe power of Dogecoin's memes cannot be underestimated, particularly in the tech-savvy online community. The currency's widespread appeal among internet users has translated into real economic impact, driving significant gains for investors. In contrast, Ripple's more traditional approach may not resonate as strongly with the meme-loving crypto crowd.\n\n## Dogecoin's Proof of Work Strength\n\nDogecoin's use of proof-of-work technology has helped solidify its position in the market, providing stability during times of volatility. Investors are drawn to Dogecoin's proof-of-work system due to its ability to prevent inflation and maintain buying power. This, coupled with the currency's association with Elon Musk, gives Dogecoin a strong foundation for future growth.\n\n## Potential Fed Rate Cuts Could Benefit Dogecoin\n\nAs economists predict potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year, the demand for inflation shelters like Bitcoin and Dogecoin could increase. With the possibility of rising prices due to government spending, investors may turn to cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation. This could further bolster Dogecoin's position in the market.\n\nIn conclusion, while Ripple may have advantages in terms of partnerships and legal clarity, Dogecoin's association with Elon Musk, meme power, large holder inflows, and proof-of-work technology give it a competitive edge. As the battle for market cap dominance continues, investors will be closely watching the developments in the cryptocurrency market.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br>## Bitcoin's Recent Price Dip: A Buying Opportunity?\n\n### Bitcoin's Price Fluctuations\nAt the beginning of May, Bitcoin's price dipped below $60,000, marking a two-month low. This decline came right after the Bitcoin halving, leaving many crypto investors concerned. However, the price has now stabilized around $65,000, still 10% below its all-time high of $73,750 in mid-March. The big question now is whether this dip presents a buying opportunity.\n\n### Return of Bitcoin ETF Inflows\nThe launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January has been a major driver of Bitcoin's price surge this year. But when investor inflows to these ETFs slowed in late April and early May, it signaled a possible shift in the market. The recent return of significant investor inflows in mid-May is seen as a positive signal for the market, potentially leading to a longer-term trend of increased investment in Bitcoin.\n\n### New Institutional Investors entering the Market\nSimultaneously with the slowdown in inflows, BlackRock hinted at a new wave of institutional investors planning to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Notably, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board recently announced a $100 million investment in the iShares Bitcoin Trust. This move by pension funds and other traditionally risk-averse investors could have a significant impact on Bitcoin's price in the future.\n\n### Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin\nDespite recent fluctuations, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains strong. Wall Street firm Bernstein has reiterated its price target of $100,000 for Bitcoin by the end of the year and $150,000 by 2025. Bitcoin's unique risk-reward profile, making it an attractive long-term investment, is expected to lead to continued price growth.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile Bitcoin's recent dip in price may raise concerns, many experts believe this could be a buying opportunity as the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains optimistic. With new institutional investors entering the market and a positive trend in ETF inflows, Bitcoin's price is expected to continue to rise. For investors looking to capitalize on the potential growth of Bitcoin, now might be the right time to consider adding it to their portfolios.\n<br>"

              "__cdata": "<br><h2>TON Emerges as Top-Performing Layer 1 Blockchain in 2024</h2>\n\n<p>In a recent analysis by CryptoQuant, the Telegram Open Network (TON) has been identified as one of the top-performing Layer 1 blockchains in 2024. TON has shown an impressive 118% outperformance over Bitcoin since the start of the year, setting itself apart from other popular Layer 1 chains that have struggled to gain momentum.</p>\n\n<p>According to the intelligence resource, only TON and BNB have significantly surpassed Bitcoin in performance during this period. The strong relative strength of TON, coupled with the network effect provided by Telegram, positions it as a notable cryptocurrency to watch during the current bull run.</p>\n\n<h3>TON Network Overview</h3>\n\n<p>Despite facing initial challenges, the Telegram Open Network has experienced substantial growth over the past year, becoming one of the largest projects in the cryptocurrency industry in terms of total market capitalization. This growth can be attributed to the vibrant and expanding ecosystem of TON, which has attracted a growing number of developers and users, fostering engagement and innovation within the blockchain.</p>\n\n<p>One notable project on the TON network is Notcoin (NOT), a viral Telegram game aimed at introducing users to Web3 on the blockchain. Recently, Notcoin announced a donation of 1.03 billion NOT, equivalent to $6.8 million, to Telegram founder Pavel Durov and Telegram.</p>\n\n<h3>Teaming Up With Tether</h3>\n\n<p>Supporting TON’s performance are key partnerships forged by The Open Network in recent months. Tether, a prominent stablecoin issuer, collaborated with TON and the Oobit mobile app to enable USDT-to-fiat transactions. This partnership allows TON users to use Oobit’s Tap & Pay technology to make payments in fiat currency while spending USDT, simplifying transactions with Tether’s USDT and Tether Gold (XAUt) on the TON network.</p>\n\n<p>These strategic collaborations and the growing ecosystem within the TON network signal a promising outlook for the blockchain in 2024, reinforcing its position as a leading player in the crypto space.</p>\n<br>"

Decentraland (MANA) topped the ranking with a ratio of 267.57. Following closely behind are Flow (FLOW) with 234.7 and Metaplex (MPLX) with 40.43.</p>\n\n<p>Enjin Coin (ENJ) and The Sandbox (SAND) also made it to the top 5, showing increased trading volume and development activity in recent days.</p>\n\n<h2>Axie Infinity Lags Behind</h2>\n\n<p>While some NFT-linked tokens are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, others are still struggling to reclaim their historical peak values. Axie Infinity (AXS), the governance token of the popular gaming universe, is a prime example.</p>\n\n<p>Despite being one of the most well-known coins in the NFT niche, Axie Infinity (AXS) is currently far from its glory days in November 2021.
